	Abstract = {We analyse the anisotropic clustering of massive galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) Data Release 9 (DR9) sample, which consists of 264 283 galaxies in the redshift range 0.43 < z < 0.7 spanning 3275 deg2. Both peculiar velocities and errors in the assumed redshift-distance relation ('Alcock-Paczynski effect') generate correlations between clustering amplitude and orientation with respect to the line of sight. Together with the sharp baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) standard ruler, our measurements of the broad-band shape of the monopole and quadrupole correlation functions simultaneously constrain the comoving angular diameter distance (2190 $\pm$ 61 Mpc) to z = 0.57, the Hubble expansion rate at z = 0.57 (92.4 $\pm$ 4.5 km s-1 Mpc-1) and the growth rate of structure at that same redshift (dsigma8/d ln a = 0.43 $\pm$ 0.069). Our analysis provides the best current direct determination of both DA and H in galaxy clustering data using this technique. If we further assume a Lambdacold dark matter expansion history, our growth constraint tightens to dsigma8/d ln a = 0.415 $\pm$ 0.034. In combination with the cosmic microwave background, our measurements of DA, H and dsigma8/d ln a all separately require dark energy at z > 0.57, and when combined imply OmegaLambda = 0.74 $\pm$ 0.016, independent of the Universe's evolution at z < 0.57. All of these constraints assume scale-independent linear growth, and assume general relativity to compute both O(10 per cent) non-linear model corrections and our errors. In our companion paper, Samushia et al., we explore further cosmological implications of these observations.},

@article{Tinker:2012aa,
	Abstract = {We place constraints on the average density (Omega m ) and clustering amplitude (sigma8) of matter using a combination of two measurements from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey: the galaxy two-point correlation function, wp (rp ), and the mass-to-galaxy-number ratio within galaxy clusters, M/N, analogous to cluster M/L ratios. Our wp (rp ) measurements are obtained from DR7 while the sample of clusters is the maxBCG sample, with cluster masses derived from weak gravitational lensing. We construct nonlinear galaxy bias models using the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) to fit both wp (rp ) and M/N for different cosmological parameters. HOD models that match the same two-point clustering predict different numbers of galaxies in massive halos when Omega m  or sigma8 is varied, thereby breaking the degeneracy between cosmology and bias. We demonstrate that this technique yields constraints that are consistent and competitive with current results from cluster abundance studies, without the use of abundance information. Using wp (rp ) and M/N alone, we find Omega0.5  m sigma8 = 0.465 $\pm$ 0.026, with individual constraints of Omega m  = 0.29 $\pm$ 0.03 and sigma8 = 0.85 $\pm$ 0.06. Combined with current cosmic microwave background data, these constraints are Omega m  = 0.290 $\pm$ 0.016 and sigma8 = 0.826 $\pm$ 0.020. All errors are 1sigma. The systematic uncertainties that the M/N technique are most sensitive to are the amplitude of the bias function of dark matter halos and the possibility of redshift evolution between the SDSS Main sample and the maxBCG cluster sample. Our derived constraints are insensitive to the current level of uncertainties in the halo mass function and in the mass-richness relation of clusters and its scatter, making the M/N technique complementary to cluster abundances as a method for constraining cosmology with future galaxy surveys.},

@article{Davis:1985aa,
	Abstract = {The results of numerical simulations of nonlinear gravitational clustering in universes dominated by weakly interacting, 'cold' dark matter are presented. The numerical methods used and the way in which initial conditions were generated are described, and the simulations performed are catalogued. The evolution of the fundamental statistical properties of the models is described and their comparability with observation is discussed. Graphical comparisons of these open models with the observed galaxy distribution in a large redshift survey are made. It is concluded that a model with a cosmological density parameter omega equal to one is quite unacceptable if galaxies trace the mass distribution, and that models with omega of roughly two, while better, still do not provide a fully acceptable match with observation. Finally, a situation in which galaxy formation is suppressed except in sufficiently dense regions is modelled which leads to models which can agree with observation quite well even for omega equal to one.},

@article{Gil-Marin:2014aa,
	Abstract = {We analyse the anisotropic clustering of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) CMASS Data Release 11 sample, which consists of 690827 galaxies in the redshift range 0.43<z<0.70 and has a sky coverage of 8498 deg$^2$ corresponding to an effective volume of $\sim6\,\rm{Gpc}^3$. We fit the Fourier space statistics, the power spectrum and bispectrum monopoles to measure the linear and quadratic bias parameters, $b_1$ and $b_2$, for a non-linear non-local bias model, the growth of structure parameter $f$ and the amplitude of dark matter density fluctuations parametrised by $\sigma_8$. We obtain $b_1(z_{\rm eff})^{1.40}\sigma_8(z_{\rm eff})=1.672\pm 0.060$ and $b_2^{0.30}(z_{\rm eff})\sigma_8(z_{\rm eff})=0.579\pm0.082$ at the effective redshift of the survey, $z_{\rm eff}=0.57$. The main cosmological result is the constraint on the combination $f^{0.43}(z_{\rm eff})\sigma_8(z_{\rm eff})=0.582\pm0.084$, which is complementary to $f\sigma_8$ constraints obtained from 2-point redshift space distortion analyses. A less conservative analysis yields $f^{0.43}(z_{\rm eff})\sigma_8(z_{\rm eff})=0.584\pm0.051$. We ensure that our result is robust by performing detailed systematic tests using a large suite of survey galaxy mock catalogs and N-body simulations. The constraints on $f^{0.43}\sigma_8$ are useful for setting additional constrains on neutrino mass, gravity, curvature as well as the number of neutrino species from galaxy surveys analyses (as presented in a companion paper).},

	Abstract = {We analyse the anisotropic clustering of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) CMASS Data Release 11 (DR11) sample, which consists of 690 827 galaxies in the redshift range 0.43 < z < 0.7 and has a sky coverage of 8498 deg2. We perform our analysis in Fourier space using a power spectrum estimator suggested by Yamamoto et al. We measure the multipole power spectra in a self-consistent manner for the first time in the sense that we provide a proper way to treat the survey window function and the integral constraint, without the commonly used assumption of an isotropic power spectrum and without the need to split the survey into subregions. The main cosmological signals exploited in our analysis are the baryon acoustic oscillations and the signal of redshift space distortions, both of which are distorted by the Alcock-Paczynski effect. Together, these signals allow us to constrain the distance ratio DV(zeff)/rs(zd) = 13.89 $\pm$ 0.18, the Alcock-Paczynski parameter FAP(zeff) = 0.679 $\pm$ 0.031 and the growth rate of structure f (zeff)sigma8(zeff) = 0.419 $\pm$ 0.044 at the effective redshift zeff = 0.57. We emphasize that our constraints are robust against possible systematic uncertainties. In order to ensure this, we perform a detailed systematics study against CMASS mock galaxy catalogues and N-body simulations. We find that such systematics will lead to 3.1 per cent uncertainty for fsigma8 if we limit our fitting range to k = 0.01-0.20 h Mpc-1, where the statistical uncertainty is expected to be three times larger. We did not find significant systematic uncertainties for DV/rs or FAP. Combining our data set with Planck to test General Relativity (GR) through the simple gamma-parametrization, where the growth rate is given by f(z) = Omega ^{gamma }_m(z), reveals a ˜2sigma tension between the data and the prediction by GR. The tension between our result and GR can be traced back to a tension in the clustering amplitude sigma8 between CMASS and Planck.},

@article{Cole:2005aa,
	Abstract = {We present a power-spectrum analysis of the final 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS), employing a direct Fourier method. The sample used comprises 221414 galaxies with measured redshifts. We investigate in detail the modelling of the sample selection, improving on previous treatments in a number of respects. A new angular mask is derived, based on revisions to the photometric calibration. The redshift selection function is determined by dividing the survey according to rest-frame colour, and deducing a self-consistent treatment of k-corrections and evolution for each population. The covariance matrix for the power-spectrum estimates is determined using two different approaches to the construction of mock surveys, which are used to demonstrate that the input cosmological model can be correctly recovered. We discuss in detail the possible differences between the galaxy and mass power spectra, and treat these using simulations, analytic models and a hybrid empirical approach. Based on these investigations, we are confident that the 2dFGRS power spectrum can be used to infer the matter content of the universe. On large scales, our estimated power spectrum shows evidence for the `baryon oscillations' that are predicted in cold dark matter (CDM) models. Fitting to a CDM model, assuming a primordial ns= 1 spectrum, h= 0.72 and negligible neutrino mass, the preferred parameters are Omegamh= 0.168 +/- 0.016 and a baryon fraction Omegab/Omegam= 0.185 +/- 0.046 (1sigma errors). The value of Omegamh is 1sigma lower than the 0.20 +/- 0.03 in our 2001 analysis of the partially complete 2dFGRS. This shift is largely due to the signal from the newly sampled regions of space, rather than the refinements in the treatment of observational selection. This analysis therefore implies a density significantly below the standard Omegam= 0.3: in combination with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), we infer Omegam= 0.231 +/- 0.021.},

@article{Percival:2004aa,
	Abstract = {We extend the Fourier transform based method for the analysis of galaxy redshift surveys of Feldman, Kaiser & Peacock (FKP) to model luminosity-dependent clustering. In a magnitude-limited survey, galaxies at high redshift are more luminous on average than galaxies at low redshift. Galaxy clustering is observed to increase with luminosity, so the inferred density field is effectively multiplied by an increasing function of radius. This has the potential to distort the shape of the recovered power spectrum. In this paper, we present an extension of the FKP analysis method to incorporate this effect, and present revised optimal weights to maximize the precision of such an analysis. The method is tested and its accuracy is assessed using mock catalogues of the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey (2dFGRS). We also show that the systematic effect caused by ignoring luminosity-dependent bias was negligible for the initial analysis of the 2dFGRS of Percival et al. However, future surveys, sensitive to larger scales, or covering a wider range of galaxy luminosities, will benefit from this refined method.},

MPFIT inherits the robustness of the original FORTRAN version of MINPACK-1, but is optimized for performance and convenience in IDL.  In addition to the main fitting engine, MPFIT, several specialized functions are provided to fit 1-D curves and 2-D images, 1-D and 2-D peaks, and interactive fitting from the IDL command line.  Several constraints can be applied to model parameters, including fixed constraints, simple bounding constraints, and ``tying'' the value to another parameter.  Several data-weighting methods are allowed, and the parameter covariance matrix is computed. Extensive diagnostic capabilities are available during the fit, via a call-back subroutine, and after the fit is complete.  Several different forms of documentation are provided, including a tutorial, reference pages, and frequently asked questions.  The package has been translated to C and Python as well.

@article{Scoccimarro:2002aa,
	Abstract = {Current models of galaxy formation applied to understanding the large-scale structure of the Universe have two parts. The first is an accurate solution of the equations of motion for the dark matter caused by gravitational clustering. The second consists of making physically reasonable approximations to the behaviour of baryons inside dark matter haloes. The first uses large, computationally intensive, N-body simulations. We argue that because the second step is, at least at present, uncertain, it is possible to obtain similar galaxy distributions without solving the first step exactly. We describe an algorithm that is several orders of magnitude faster than N-body simulations, but that is, nevertheless, rather accurate. The algorithm combines perturbation theory with virialized halo models of the non-linear density and velocity fields. For two- and three-point statistics the resulting fields are exact on large scales, and rather accurate well into the non-linear regime, particularly for two-point statistics in real and redshift space. We then show how one can use this algorithm to generate mock galaxy distributions from halo occupation numbers. As a first application, we show that it provides a good description of the clustering of galaxies in the PSCz survey. We also discuss applications to the estimation of non-Gaussian contributions to the error bars and the covariance matrix of the power spectrum, in real and redshift space, for galaxies and dark matter. The results for the latter show good agreement with simulations, supporting the use of our method for constraining cosmological parameters from forthcoming galaxy surveys.},

	Abstract = {A sample of 1095 single (S) and associated (A) galaxies with apparent brightness not less than 14.0 magnitudes is analyzed empirically to determine whether the S galaxies have the statistical properties expected of a field population. Two-point functions describing the clustering of the S galaxies and their correlation with the A galaxies are examined, and the frequency distributions of nearest neighbors are considered for both the S and A galaxies. Cross correlations of the S and A components with fainter galaxies listed in the Zwicky catalog are investigated, the number-magnitude relations for S and A galaxies are discussed, and it is found that both components share the same inhomogeneous clustered distribution around the Galaxy. Model catalogs based on hierarchical clustering are constructed which show that the S component can be accounted for without invoking any field population at all. It is concluded that if there is a galaxy population that might usefully be called a uniform field, it amounts to substantially less than 18% in a sample selected by apparent magnitude. In this case, so-called field galaxies might be members of diffuse outer components of groups and clusters of galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We develop a general method for power-spectrum analysis of three-dimensional redshift surveys. We present rigorous analytical estimates for the statistical uncertainty in the power, and we are able to derive a rigorous optimal weighting scheme under the reasonable (and largely empirically verified) assumption that the long-wavelength Fourier components are Gaussian-distributed. We apply the formalism to the updated one-in-six Queen Mary College, Durham, Oxford, and Toronto (QDOT) IRAS redshift survey and compare our results with data from other probes: APM angular correlations and the CfA and the Berkeley 1.2 Jy IRAS redshift surveys. Our results bear out and further quantify the impression from, e.g., counts-in-cells analysis that there is extra power on large scales as compared to the standard cold dark matter (CDM) model with (Omega h) approx. = 0.5. We apply likelihood analysis using the CDM spectrum with (Omega h) as a free parameter as a phenomenological family of models; we find the best-fitting parameters in redshift space and transform the results to real space. Finally, we calculate the distribution of the estimated long-wavelength power. This agrees remarkably well with the exponential distribution expected for Gaussian fluctuations, even out to powers of 10 times the mean. Our results thus reveal no trace of periodicity or other non-Gaussian behavior.},

	Abstract = {Sophisticated analysis of modern large-scale structure surveys requires mock catalogues. Mock catalogues are used to optimize survey design, test reduction and analysis pipelines, make theoretical predictions for basic observables and propagate errors through complex analysis chains. We present a new method, which we call `quick particle mesh', for generating many large volume, approximate mock catalogues at low computational cost. The method is based on using rapid, low-resolution particle mesh simulations that accurately reproduce the large-scale dark matter density field. Particles are sampled from the density field based on their local density such that they have N-point statistics nearly equivalent to the haloes resolved in high-resolution simulations, creating a set of mock haloes that can be populated using halo occupation methods to create galaxy mocks for a variety of possible target classes.},

	Abstract = {We present measurements of galaxy clustering from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), which is part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III). These use the Data Release 9 (DR9) CMASS sample, which contains 264 283 massive galaxies covering 3275 square degrees with an effective redshift z = 0.57 and redshift range 0.43 < z < 0.7. Assuming a concordance LambdaCDM cosmological model, this sample covers an effective volume of 2.2 Gpc3, and represents the largest sample of the Universe ever surveyed at this density, n¯≈3×10-4 h-3 Mpc 3. We measure the angle-averaged galaxy correlation function and power spectrum, including density-field reconstruction of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature. The acoustic features are detected at a significance of 5sigma in both the correlation function and power spectrum. Combining with the SDSS-II luminous red galaxy sample, the detection significance increases to 6.7sigma. Fitting for the position of the acoustic features measures the distance to z = 0.57 relative to the sound horizon DV/rs = 13.67 $\pm$ 0.22 at z = 0.57. Assuming a fiducial sound horizon of 153.19 Mpc, which matches cosmic microwave background constraints, this corresponds to a distance DV (z = 0.57) = 2094 $\pm$ 34 Mpc. At 1.7 per cent, this is the most precise distance constraint ever obtained from a galaxy survey. We place this result alongside previous BAO measurements in a cosmological distance ladder and find excellent agreement with the current supernova measurements. We use these distance measurements to constrain various cosmological models, finding continuing support for a flat Universe with a cosmological constant.},

	Abstract = {We present a fast method for producing mock galaxy catalogues that can be used to compute the covariance of large-scale clustering measurements and test analysis techniques. Our method populates a second-order Lagrangian perturbation theory (2LPT) matter field, where we calibrate masses of dark matter haloes by detailed comparisons with N-body simulations. We demonstrate that the clustering of haloes is recovered at ˜10 per cent accuracy. We populate haloes with mock galaxies using a halo occupation distribution (HOD) prescription, which has been calibrated to reproduce the clustering measurements on scales between 30 and 80 h-1 Mpc. We compare the sample covariance matrix from our mocks with analytic estimates, and discuss differences. We have used this method to make catalogues corresponding to Data Release 9 of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), producing 600 mock catalogues of the `CMASS' galaxy sample. These mocks have enabled detailed tests of methods and errors, and have formed an integral part of companion analyses of these galaxy data.},

	Abstract = {The statistical strength of galaxy redshift surveys, such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), have ushered us into the era of precision measurements of galaxy clustering. We are now fitting physical models to measured clustering statistics. Galaxy clustering is thus in a position to directly constrain cosmological and galaxy formation theories. This paradigm shift from qualitative to quantitative demands that we understand the statistical and systematic errors in our measurements. Moreover, we must quantify the theoretical uncertainties in our models, which are no longer clearly sub-dominant to observational errors.  We address this emerging need with the LasDamas project (LArge Suite of DArk MAtter Simulations) by producing an unprecedented number of independent and realistic mock galaxy catalogs. To date, we have run over 100 independent N-body realizations using a fixed cosmology and initialized using 2nd order Lagrangian perturbation theory. We populate overdensities of dark matter using the halo occupation distribution framework, designed to match both small and large scale clustering of the observed SDSS data. A series of mock galaxy catalogs matching the geometry of the final SDSS release (DR7) are created over a wide luminosity range to correspond to Main and LRG volume-limited samples. We include important observational effects, such as redshift distortions and fiber collisions. These galaxy mocks are publicly available.},

@article{Guo:2012aa,
	Abstract = {In fiber-fed galaxy redshift surveys, the finite size of the fiber plugs prevents two fibers from being placed too close to one another, limiting the ability to study galaxy clustering on all scales. We present a new method for correcting such fiber collision effects in galaxy clustering statistics based on spectroscopic observations. The target galaxy sample is divided into two distinct populations according to the targeting algorithm of fiber placement, one free of fiber collisions and the other consisting of collided galaxies. The clustering statistics are a combination of the contributions from these two populations. Our method makes use of observations in tile overlap regions to measure the contributions from the collided population, and to therefore recover the full clustering statistics. The method is rooted in solid theoretical ground and is tested extensively on mock galaxy catalogs. We demonstrate that our method can well recover the projected and the full three-dimensional (3D) redshift-space two-point correlation functions (2PCFs) on scales both below and above the fiber collision scale, superior to the commonly used nearest neighbor and angular correction methods. We discuss potential systematic effects in our method. The statistical correction accuracy of our method is only limited by sample variance, which scales down with (the square root of) the volume probed. For a sample similar to the final SDSS-III BOSS galaxy sample, the statistical correction error is expected to be at the level of 1% on scales ~0.1-30 h -1 Mpc for the 2PCFs. The systematic error only occurs on small scales, caused by imperfect correction of collision multiplets, and its magnitude is expected to be smaller than 5%. Our correction method, which can be generalized to other clustering statistics as well, enables more accurate measurements of full 3D galaxy clustering on all scales with galaxy redshift surveys.},
