	Abstract = {We explore the simple inter-relationships between mass, star formation rate, and environment in the SDSS, zCOSMOS, and other deep surveys. We take a purely empirical approach in identifying those features of galaxy evolution that are demanded by the data and then explore the analytic consequences of these. We show that the differential effects of mass and environment are completely separable to z ~ 1, leading to the idea of two distinct processes of "mass quenching" and "environment quenching." The effect of environment quenching, at fixed over-density, evidently does not change with epoch to z ~ 1 in zCOSMOS, suggesting that the environment quenching occurs as large-scale structure develops in the universe, probably through the cessation of star formation in 30%-70% of satellite galaxies. In contrast, mass quenching appears to be a more dynamic process, governed by a quenching rate. We show that the observed constancy of the Schechter M* and alphas for star-forming galaxies demands that the quenching of galaxies around and above M* must follow a rate that is statistically proportional to their star formation rates (or closely mimic such a dependence). We then postulate that this simple mass-quenching law in fact holds over a much broader range of stellar mass (2 dex) and cosmic time. We show that the combination of these two quenching processes, plus some additional quenching due to merging naturally produces (1) a quasi-static single Schechter mass function for star-forming galaxies with an exponential cutoff at a value M* that is set uniquely by the constant of proportionality between the star formation and mass quenching rates and (2) a double Schechter function for passive galaxies with two components. The dominant component (at high masses) is produced by mass quenching and has exactly the same M* as the star-forming galaxies but a faint end slope that differs by Deltaalphas ~ 1. The other component is produced by environment effects and has the same M* and alphas as the star-forming galaxies but an amplitude that is strongly dependent on environment. Subsequent merging of quenched galaxies will modify these predictions somewhat in the denser environments, mildly increasing M* and making alphas slightly more negative. All of these detailed quantitative inter-relationships between the Schechter parameters of the star-forming and passive galaxies, across a broad range of environments, are indeed seen to high accuracy in the SDSS, lending strong support to our simple empirically based model. We find that the amount of post-quenching "dry merging" that could have occurred is quite constrained. Our model gives a prediction for the mass function of the population of transitory objects that are in the process of being quenched. Our simple empirical laws for the cessation of star formation in galaxies also naturally produce the "anti-hierarchical" run of mean age with mass for passive galaxies, as well as the qualitative variation of formation timescale indicated by the relative alpha-element abundances.

	Abstract = {Context: For more than two decades we have known that galaxy morphological segregation is present in the Local Universe. It is important to see how this relation evolves with cosmic time.   Aims: To investigate how galaxy assembly took place with cosmic time, we explore the evolution of the morphology-density relation up to redshift z ~ 1 using about 10 000 galaxies drawn from the zCOSMOS Galaxy Redshift Survey. Taking advantage of accurate HST/ACS morphologies from the COSMOS survey, of the well-characterised zCOSMOS 3D environment, and of a large sample of galaxies with spectroscopic redshift, we want to study here the evolution of the morphology-density relation up to z ~ 1 and its dependence on galaxy luminosity and stellar mass. The multi-wavelength coverage of the field also allows a first study of the galaxy morphological segregation dependence on colour. We further attempt to disentangle between processes that occurred early in the history of the Universe or late in the life of galaxies.  Methods: The zCOSMOS field benefits of high-resolution imaging in the F814W filter from the Advanced Camera for Survey (ACS). We use standard morphology classifiers, optimised for being robust against band-shifting and surface brightness dimming, and a new, objective, and automated method to convert morphological parameters into early, spiral, and irregular types. We use about 10 000 galaxies down to I_AB = 22.5 with a spectroscopic sampling rate of 33% to characterise the environment of galaxies up to z ~ 1 from the 100 kpc scales of galaxy groups up to the 100 Mpc scales of the cosmic web. The evolution of the morphology-density relation in different environments is then studied for luminosity and stellar-mass selected, volume-limited samples of galaxies. The trends are described and related to the various physical processes that could play a relevant role in the build-up of the morphology-density relation.  Results: We confirm that the morphological segregation is present up to z ~ 1 for luminosity-selected, volume-limited samples. The behaviour of the morphology-density relation gets flatter at fixed masses expecially above 1010.6 M&sun;. We suggest the existence of a critical mass above which the physical processes governing galaxy stellar mass also determine the shaping of the galaxy more than its environment. We finally show that at a fixed morphology there is still a residual variation in galaxy colours with density.   Conclusions: The observed evolution with redshift of the morphology-density relation offers an opportunity to trace the effect of nature and nurture as a function of environment. Even though it is based mainly on a biased view, the environmental dependence of the morphological evolution for luminosity-selected, volume-limited samples seems to indicate that nurture is in play. On the other hand, the lack of evolution observed for early-type and spiral galaxies that are more massive than 1010.8 M&sun; independents of the environment indicates that nature has imprinted these properties early in the life of these galaxies. We conclude that the relative contribution of nature and nurture in different environments strongly depends on the mass of galaxies, consistent with a downsizing scenario.  Based on observations obtained at the European Southern  Observatory (ESO) Very Large Telescope (VLT), Paranal, Chile, as part of the  Large Program 175.A-0839 (the zCOSMOS Spectroscopic Redshift Survey).},

@article{McCarthy:2008aa,
	Abstract = {We use a large suite of carefully controlled full hydrodynamic simulations to study the ram pressure stripping of the hot gaseous haloes of galaxies as they fall into massive groups and clusters. The sensitivity of the results to the orbit, total galaxy mass, and galaxy structural properties is explored. For typical structural and orbital parameters, we find that ~30 per cent of the initial hot galactic halo gas can remain in place after 10 Gyr. We propose a physically simple analytic model that describes the stripping seen in the simulations remarkably well. The model is analogous to the original formulation of Gunn & Gott, except that it is appropriate for the case of a spherical (hot) gas distribution (as opposed to a face-on cold disc) and takes into account that stripping is not instantaneous but occurs on a characteristic time-scale. The model reproduces the results of the simulations to within ~10 per cent at almost all times for all the orbits, mass ratios, and galaxy structural properties we have explored. The one exception involves unlikely systems where the orbit of the galaxy is highly non-radial and its mass exceeds about 10 per cent of the group or cluster into which it is falling (in which case the model underpredicts the stripping following pericentric passage). The proposed model has several interesting applications, including modelling the ram pressure stripping of both observed and cosmologically simulated galaxies and as a way to improve present semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. One immediate consequence is that the colours and morphologies of satellite galaxies in groups and clusters will differ significantly from those predicted with the standard assumption of complete stripping of the hot coronae.},

@article{Scodeggio:2009aa,
	Abstract = {Context: Hierarchical models of galaxy formation predict that the properties of a dark matter halo depend on the large-scale environment surrounding the halo. As a result of this correlation, we expect massive haloes to be present in larger number in overdense regions than in underdense ones. Given that a correlation exists between a galaxy stellar mass and the hosting dark matter halo mass, the segregation in dark matter halo mass should then result in a segregation in the distribution of stellar mass in the galaxy population.  Aims: In this work we study the distribution of galaxy stellar mass and rest-frame optical color as a function of the large-scale galaxy distribution using the VLT VIMOS Deep Survey sample, in order to verify the presence of segregation in the properties of the galaxy population. Methods: We use VVDS redshift measurements and multi-band photometric data to derive estimates of the stellar mass, rest-frame optical color, and of the large-scale galaxy density, on a scale of approximately 8 Mpc, for a sample of 5619 galaxies in the redshift range 0.2<z<1.4.  Results: We observe a significant mass and optical color segregation over the whole redshift interval covered by our sample, such that the median value of the mass distribution is larger and the rest-frame optical color is redder in regions of high galaxy density. The amplitude of the mass segregation changes little with redshift, at least in the high stellar mass regime that we can uniformly sample over the 0.2 < z < 1.4 redshift interval. The color segregation, instead, decreases significantly for z > 0.7. However, when we consider only galaxies in narrow bins of stellar mass, in order to exclude the effects of stellar mass segregation on galaxy properties, we no longer observe any significant color segregation.

The evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) in high and low density regions provides a tool to study the mass assembly evolution in different environments; moreover, the contributions to the GSMF from different galaxy types, as defined by their SEDs and their morphologies, can be quantified. At redshift z ~ 1, the GSMF is only slightly dependent on environment, but at lower redshifts the shapes of the GSMFs in high- and low-density environments become extremely different, with high density regions exhibiting a marked bimodality, not reproducible by a single Schechter function. As a result of this analysis, we infer that galaxy evolution depends on both the stellar mass and the environment, the latter setting the probability of a galaxy to have a given mass: all the galaxy properties related to the stellar mass show a dependence on environment, reflecting the difference observed in the mass functions. The shapes of the GSMFs of early- and late-type galaxies are almost identical for the extremes of the density contrast we consider, ranging from isolated galaxies to rich group members. The evolution toward z = 0 of the transition mass M_cross, i.e., the mass at which the early- and late-type GSMFs match each other, is more rapid in high density environments, because of a difference in the evolution of the normalisation of GSMFs compared to the total one in the considered environment. The same result is found by studying the relative contributions of different galaxy types, implying that there is a more rapid evolution in overdense regions, in particular for intermediate stellar masses. The rate of evolution is different for sets of galaxy types divided on the basis of their SEDs or their morphologies, tentatively suggesting that the migration from the blue cloud to the red sequence occurs on a shorter timescale than the transformation from disc-like morphologies to ellipticals. Our analysis suggests that environmental mechanisms of galaxy transformation start to be more effective at z < 1. The comparison of the observed GSMFs to the same quantities derived from a set of mock catalogues based on semi-analytical models shows disagreement, in both low and high density environments: in particular, blue galaxies in sparse environments are overproduced in the semi-analytical models at intermediate and high masses, because of a deficit of star formation suppression, while at z < 0.5 an excess of red galaxies is present in dense environments at intermediate and low masses, because of the overquenching of satellites.

	Abstract = {We use data drawn from the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey to investigate the relationship between local galaxy density, stellar mass and rest-frame galaxy colour. At z ~ 0.9, we find that the shape of the stellar mass function at the high-mass [ log 10(M*/h-2 Msolar) > 10.1] end depends on the local environment, with high-density regions favouring more massive systems. Accounting for this stellar mass-environment relation (i.e. working at fixed stellar mass), we find a significant colour-density relation for galaxies with 10.6 < log 10(M*/h-2 Msolar) < 11.1 and 0.75 < z < 0.95. This result is shown to be robust to variations in the sample selection and to extend to even lower masses [down to log 10(M*/h-2 Msolar) ~ 10.4]. We conclude by discussing our results in comparison to recent works in the literature, which report no significant correlation between galaxy properties and environment at fixed stellar mass for the same redshift and stellar mass domain. The non-detection of environmental dependence found in other data sets is largely attributable to their smaller sample sizes and lower sampling density, as well as systematic effects such as inaccurate redshifts and biased analysis techniques. Ultimately, our results based on DEEP2 data illustrate that the evolutionary state of a galaxy at z ~ 1 is not exclusively determined by the stellar mass of the galaxy. Instead, we show that local environment appears to play a distinct role in the transformation of galaxy properties at z > 1.  Some of the data presented herein were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

@article{Kovac:2014aa,
	Abstract = {We explore the role of environment in the evolution of galaxies over 0.1 < z < 0.7 using the final zCOSMOS-bright data set. Using the red fraction of galaxies as a proxy for the quenched population, we find that the fraction of red galaxies increases with the environmental overdensity delta and with the stellar mass M*, consistent with previous works. As at lower redshift, the red fraction appears to be separable in mass and environment, suggesting the action of two processes: mass εm(M*) and environmental εrho(delta) quenching. The parameters describing these appear to be essentially the same at z ˜ 0.7 as locally. We explore the relation between red fraction, mass and environment also for the central and satellite galaxies separately, paying close attention to the effects of impurities in the central-satellite classification and using carefully constructed samples well matched in stellar mass. There is little evidence for a dependence of the red fraction of centrals on overdensity. Satellites are consistently redder at all overdensities, and the satellite quenching efficiency, εsat(delta, M*), increases with overdensity at 0.1 < z < 0.4. This is less marked at higher redshift, but both are nevertheless consistent with the equivalent local measurements. At a given stellar mass, the fraction of galaxies that are satellites, fsat(delta, M*), also increases with overdensity. The obtained εrho(delta)/fsat(delta, M*) agrees well with εsat(delta, M*), demonstrating that the environmental quenching in the overall population is consistent with being entirely produced by a satellite quenching process at least up to z = 0.7. However, despite the unprecedented size of our high-redshift samples, the associated statistical uncertainties are still significant and our statements should be understood as approximations to physical reality, rather than physically exact formulae.},

@article{Cucciati:2010aa,
	Abstract = {Aims: With the first ˜10 000 spectra of the flux limited zCOSMOS sample (IAB <= 22.5) we want to study the evolution of environmental effects on galaxy properties since z ~ 1.0, and to disentangle the dependence among galaxy colour, stellar mass and local density.  Methods: We use our previously derived 3D local density contrast delta, computed with the 5th nearest neighbour approach, to study the evolution with z of the environmental effects on galaxy U-B colour, D4000 {\AA}break and [OII]lambda3727 equivalent width (EW[OII]). We also analyze the implications due to the use of different galaxy selections, using luminosity or stellar mass, and we disentangle the relations among colour, stellar mass and delta studying the colour-density relation in narrow mass bins.  Results: We confirm that within a luminosity-limited sample (MB <= -20.5 - z) the fraction of red (U-B >= 1) galaxies depends on delta at least up to z ~ 1, with red galaxies residing mainly in high densities. This trend becomes weaker for increasing redshifts, and it is mirrored by the behaviour of the fraction of galaxies with D4000 {\AA} break >= 1.4. We also find that up to z ~ 1 the fraction of galaxies with log (EW[OII]) >= 1.15 is higher for lower delta, and also this dependence weakens for increasing z. Given the triple dependence among galaxy colours, stellar mass and delta, the colour-delta relation that we find in the luminosity-selected sample can be due to the broad range of stellar masses embedded in the sample. Thus, we study the colour-delta relation in narrow mass bins within mass complete subsamples, defining red galaxies with a colour threshold roughly parallel to the red sequence in the colour-mass plane. We find that once mass is fixed the colour-delta relation is globally flat up to z ~ 1 for galaxies with log(M/M&sun;) ≳ 10.7. This means that for these masses any colour-delta relation found within a luminosity-selected sample is the result of the combined colour-mass and mass-delta relations. On the contrary, even at fixed mass we observe that within 0.1 <= z <= 0.5 the fraction of red galaxies with log(M/M&sun;) ≲ 10.7 depends on delta. For these mass and redshift ranges, environment affects directly also galaxy colours.  Conclusions: We suggest a scenario in which the colour depends primarily on stellar mass, but for an intermediate mass regime (10.2 ≲ log(M/M&sun;) ≲ 10.7) the local density modulates this dependence. These relatively low mass galaxies formed more recently, in an epoch when more evolved structures were already in place, and their longer SFH allowed environment-driven physical processes to operate during longer periods of time.

The galaxy population naturally divides into a red and blue sequence with the locus of the sequences in colour-mass and colour-concentration indices not varying strongly with environment. The fraction of galaxies on the red sequence is determined in bins of 0.2 in logSigma and bins). The red fraction fr generally increases continuously in both Sigma and such that there is a unified relation: . Two simple functions are proposed which provide good fits to the data. These data are compared with analogous quantities in semi-analytical models based on the Millennium N-body simulation: the Bower et al. and Croton et al. models that incorporate active galactic nucleus feedback. Both models predict a strong dependence of the red fraction on stellar mass and environment that is qualitatively similar to the observations. However, a quantitative comparison shows that the Bower et al. model is a significantly better match; this appears to be due to the different treatment of feedback in central galaxies.},

In each cluster, those galaxies brighter than M(v) = -20 which are within the circular area containing the inner 30 percent of the total cluster population are selected. From the distribution of these galaxies in the color-magnitude plane, the fraction of galaxies whose rest-frame B-V colors are at least 0.2 mag bluer than the ridge line of the early-type galaxies at that magnitude is determined. It is found that low-redshift compact clusters form a very homogeneous group of objects with cores essentially devoid of blue galaxies. At redshifts greater than 0.1, compact clusters have significant numbers of blue galaxies, the fraction increasing with redshift. The colors of spiral galaxies in the cores of nearby clusters tend to be redder than those of spirals in the field.},

	Abstract = {Context. Groups of galaxies are a common environment, bridging the gap between starforming field galaxies and quiescent cluster galaxies. Within groups secular processes could be at play, contributing to the observed strong decrease of star formation with cosmic time in the global galaxy population.  Aims: We took advantage of the wealth of information provided by the first  10 000 galaxies of the zCOSMOS-bright survey and its group catalogue to study in detail the complex interplay between group environment and galaxy properties.  Methods: The classical indicator Fblue, i.e., the fraction of blue galaxies, proved to be a simple but powerful diagnostic tool. We studied its variation for different luminosity and mass selected galaxy samples, divided as to define groups/field/isolated galaxy subsamples.  Results: Using rest-frame evolving B-band volume-limited samples, the groups galaxy population exhibits significant blueing as redshift increases, but maintains a systematic difference (a lower Fblue) with respect to the global galaxy population, and an even larger difference with respect to the isolated galaxy population. However moving to mass selected samples it becomes apparent that such differences are largely due to the biased view imposed by the B-band luminosity selection, being driven by the population of lower mass, bright blue galaxies for which we miss the redder, equally low mass, counterparts. By carefully focusing the analysis on narrow mass bins such that mass segregation becomes negligible we find that only for the lowest mass bin explored, i.e., log ({\cal M}*/{\cal M}&sun;) <= 10.6 , does a significant residual difference in color remain as a function of environment, while this difference becomes negligible toward higher masses.  Conclusions: Our results indicate that red galaxies of mass log ({\cal M}*/{\cal M}&sun;) >= 10.8 are already in place at z   1 and do not exhibit any strong environmental dependence, possibly originating from so-called nature or internal mechanisms. In contrast, for lower galaxy masses and redshifts lower than z   1, we observe the emergence in groups of a population of nurture red galaxies: slightly deviating from the trend of the downsizing scenario followed by the global galaxy population, and more so with cosmic time. These galaxies exhibit signatures of group-related secular physical mechanisms directly influencing galaxy evolution. Our analysis implies that these mechanisms begin to significantly influence galaxy evolution after z   1, a redshift corresponding to the emergence of structures in which these mechanisms take place.  based on data obtained with the European Southern Observatory Very Large Telescope, Paranal, Chile, program 175.A-0839, PI: S.

	Abstract = {We demonstrate that dwarf galaxies (107 < M stellar < 109 M &sun;, -12 > Mr > -18) with no active star formation are extremely rare (<0.06%) in the field. Our sample is based on the NASA-Sloan Atlas which is a reanalysis of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 8. We examine the relative number of quenched versus star-forming dwarf galaxies, defining quenched galaxies as having no Halpha emission (EWHalpha < 2 {\AA}) and a strong 4000 {\AA} break. The fraction of quenched dwarf galaxies decreases rapidly with increasing distance from a massive host, leveling off for distances beyond 1.5 Mpc. We define galaxies beyond 1.5 Mpc of a massive host galaxy to be in the field. We demonstrate that there is a stellar mass threshold of M stellar < 1.0 × 109 M &sun; below which quenched galaxies do not exist in the field. Below this threshold, we find that none of the 2951 field dwarf galaxies are quenched; all field dwarf galaxies show evidence for recent star formation. Correcting for volume effects, this corresponds to a 1sigma upper limit on the quenched fraction of 0.06%. In more dense environments, quenched galaxies account for 23% of the dwarf population over the same stellar mass range. The majority of quenched dwarf galaxies (often classified as dwarf elliptical galaxies) are within 2 virial radii of a massive galaxy, and only a few percent of quenched dwarf galaxies exist beyond 4 virial radii. Thus, for galaxies with stellar mass less than 1.0 × 109 M &sun;, ending star formation requires the presence of a more massive neighbor, providing a stringent constraint on models of star formation feedback.},

@article{Tinker:2011aa,
	Abstract = {The properties of dark matter halos, including mass growth, correlate with larger scale environment at fixed mass, an effect known as assembly bias. However, whether this environmental dependence manifests itself in galaxy properties remains unclear. We apply a group-finding algorithm to DR7 of the SDSS to estimate the halo mass of each galaxy and to decompose galaxies into those that exist at the centers of distinct halos and those that orbit as satellites within larger halos. Using the 4000-A break as a measure of star formation history, we examine the correlation between the quenched fraction of galaxies, f_q, and large-scale environment, rho. At all galaxy magnitudes, there is a positive, monotonic relationship between f_q and rho. We use the group catalog to decompose this correlation into the contribution from central and satellite galaxies as a function of halo mass. Because satellites are more likely to be quenched than central galaxies, the observed f_q-rho correlation is primarily due to variations of the halo mass function with environment, which causes a larger fraction of satellite galaxies at high rho. For low-mass central galaxies (Mgal <~ 10^10.0 Msol/h^2), there is no correlation between f_q and rho. These results are inconsistent with the strong assembly bias of dark matter halos seen in this mass regime if recent galaxy growth at all correlates with recent halo growth, as we demonstrate through a high resolution N-body simulation. We also find that the mean stellar age of quenched central galaxies is independent of rho at fixed Mgal, while the formation times of low mass halos vary significantly. We conclude that the processes that halt the star formation of low mass central galaxies are not correlated to the formation histories of their host halos, and old galaxies do not reside preferentially in old halos.

MPFIT inherits the robustness of the original FORTRAN version of MINPACK-1, but is optimized for performance and convenience in IDL.  In addition to the main fitting engine, MPFIT, several specialized functions are provided to fit 1-D curves and 2-D images, 1-D and 2-D peaks, and interactive fitting from the IDL command line.  Several constraints can be applied to model parameters, including fixed constraints, simple bounding constraints, and ``tying'' the value to another parameter.  Several data-weighting methods are allowed, and the parameter covariance matrix is computed. Extensive diagnostic capabilities are available during the fit, via a call-back subroutine, and after the fit is complete.  Several different forms of documentation are provided, including a tutorial, reference pages, and frequently asked questions.  The package has been translated to C and Python as well.  The full IDL and C packages can be found at http://purl.com/net/mpfit.},

@article{Cooper:2005aa,
	Abstract = {We study the applicability of several galaxy environment measures (nth-nearest neighbor distance, counts in an aperture, and Voronoi volume) within deep redshift surveys. Mock galaxy catalogs are employed to mimic representative photometric and spectroscopic surveys at high redshift (z~1). We investigate the effects of survey edges, redshift precision, redshift-space distortions, and target selection on each environment measure. We find that even optimistic photometric redshift errors (sigmaz=0.02) smear out the line-of-sight galaxy distribution irretrievably on small scales; this significantly limits the application of photometric redshift surveys to environment studies. Edges and holes in a survey field dramatically affect the estimation of environment, with the impact of edge effects depending on the adopted environment measure. These edge effects considerably limit the usefulness of smaller survey fields (e.g., the GOODS fields) for studies of galaxy environment. In even the poorest groups and clusters, redshift-space distortions limit the effectiveness of each environment statistic; measuring density in projection (e.g., using counts in a cylindrical aperture or a projected nth-nearest neighbor distance measure) significantly improves the accuracy of measures in such overdense environments. For the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey, we conclude that among the environment estimators tested the projected nth-nearest neighbor distance measure provides the most accurate estimate of local galaxy density over a continuous and broad range of scales.},

@article{Bernardi:2013aa,
	Abstract = {In addition to the large systematic differences arising from assumptions about the stellar mass-to-light ratio, the massive end of the stellar mass function is rather sensitive to how one fits the light profiles of the most luminous galaxies. We quantify this by comparing the luminosity and stellar mass functions based on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) <monospace>cmodel</monospace> magnitudes, and <monospace>PyMorph</monospace> single-<monospace>S{\'e}rsic</monospace> and <monospace>S{\'e}rsic</monospace>-exponential fits to the surface brightness profiles of galaxies in the SDSS. The <monospace>PyMorph</monospace> fits return more light, so that the predicted masses are larger than when <monospace>cmodel</monospace> magnitudes are used. As a result, the total stellar mass density at z ˜ 0.1 is about 1.2 times larger than in our previous analysis of the SDSS. The differences are most pronounced at the massive end, where the measured number density of objects having M* >= 6 × 1011 M&sun; is approximately five times larger. Alternatively, at number densities of 10-6 Mpc-3, the limiting stellar mass is two times larger. The differences with respect to fits by other authors, typically based on <monospace>Petrosian</monospace>-like magnitudes, are even more dramatic, although some of these differences are due to sky-subtraction problems, and are sometimes masked by large differences in the assumed M*/L (even after scaling to the same initial mass function). Our results impact studies of the growth and assembly of stellar mass in galaxies, and of the relation between stellar and halo mass, so we provide simple analytic fits to these new luminosity and stellar mass functions and quantify how they depend on morphology, as well as the binned counts in electronic format. While these allow one to quantify the differences which arise because of the assumed light profile, and we believe our <monospace>S{\'e}rsic</monospace>-exponential based results to be the most realistic of the models we have tested, we caution that which profile is the most appropriate at the high-mass end is still debated.},

	Abstract = {We describe a procedure for background subtracting Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) imaging that improves the resulting detection and photometry of large galaxies on the sky. Within each SDSS drift scan run, we mask out detected sources and then fit a smooth function to the variation of the sky background. This procedure has been applied to all SDSS-III Data Release 8 images, and the results are available as part of that data set. We have tested the effect of our background subtraction on the photometry of large galaxies by inserting fake galaxies into the raw pixels, reanalyzing the data, and measuring them after background subtraction. Our technique results in no size-dependent bias in galaxy fluxes up to half-light radii r 50 ~ 100 arcsec; in contrast, for galaxies of that size the standard SDSS photometric catalog underestimates fluxes by about 1.5 mag. Our results represent a substantial improvement over the standard SDSS catalog results and should form the basis of any analysis of nearby galaxies using the SDSS imaging data.},

@article{Wilman:2010aa,
	Abstract = {We present a multiscale approach for measurements of galaxy density, applied to a volume-limited sample constructed from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 5 (SDSS DR5). We populate a rich parameter space by obtaining independent measurements of density on different scales for each galaxy. This parametrization purely relies on observations and avoids the implicit assumptions involved, e.g. in the construction of group catalogues. As the first application of this method, we study how the bimodality in galaxy colour distribution (specifically u - r) depends on multiscale density. The u - r galaxy colour distribution is described as the sum of two Gaussians (a red and a blue one) with five parameters: the fraction of red galaxies (fred) and the position and width of the red and blue peaks (mured,mublue,sigmared and sigmablue). Galaxies mostly react to their smallest scale (<0.5Mpc) environments: in denser environments red galaxies are more common (larger fred), redder (larger mured) and with a narrower distribution (smaller sigmared), while blue galaxies are redder (larger mublue) but with a broader distribution (larger sigmablue). There are residual correlations of fred and mublue with 0.5-1Mpc scale density, which imply that total or partial truncation of star formation can relate to a galaxy's environment on these scales. Beyond 1Mpc (0.5Mpc for mured) there are no positive correlations with density. However fred anticorrelates with density on >2Mpc scales at fixed density on smaller scales, and mured anticorrelates with density on >1Mpc scales. We examine these trends qualitatively in the context of the halo model, utilizing the properties of haloes within which the galaxies are embedded, derived by Yang et al. and applied to a group catalogue. This yields an excellent description of the trends with multiscale density, including the anticorrelations on large scales, which map the region of accretion on to massive haloes. Thus we conclude that galaxies become red only once they have been accreted on to haloes of a certain mass. The mean colour of red galaxies mured depends positively only on <0.5Mpc scale density, which can most easily be explained if correlations of mured with environment are driven by metallicity via the enrichment history of a galaxy within its subhalo, during its epoch of star formation.},

@article{Leja:2013aa,
	Abstract = {A central challenge in observational studies of galaxy formation is how to associate progenitor galaxies with their descendants at lower redshifts. One promising approach is to link galaxies at fixed number density rather than fixed luminosity or mass. This method is effective if stellar mass rank order is broadly conserved through cosmic time. In this paper, we use the Guo et al. semi-analytical model to analyze under what circumstances this assumption is valid in the context of a cosmological simulation. Specifically, we select progenitor galaxies at a constant number density and compare the stellar mass evolution of their descendants to the evolution at a constant number density. The median stellar mass of the descendants increases by a factor of four (0.6 dex) from z = 3 to z = 0. Constant number density selection reproduces this to within 40% (0.15 dex) over a wide range of number densities. We show that the discrepancy primarily results from scatter in the stellar mass growth rates and merging. After applying simple, observationally based corrections for these processes, the discrepancy is reduced to 12% (0.05 dex). We conclude that number density selection can be used to predict the median descendant mass of high-redshift progenitor galaxies. The main uncertainty in this study is that semi-analytical models do not reproduce the observed mass evolution of galaxies, which makes the quantitative aggregate effects of star formation, merging, and quenching on the rank order of galaxies somewhat uncertain.},

	Abstract = {Comparing galaxies across redshifts at fixed cumulative number density is a popular way to estimate the evolution of specific galaxy populations. This method ignores scatter in mass accretion histories and galaxy-galaxy mergers, which can lead to errors when comparing galaxies over large redshift ranges (Deltaz > 1). We use abundance matching in the LambdaCDM paradigm to estimate the median change in cumulative number density with redshift and provide a simple fit (+0.16 dex per unit Deltaz) for progenitors of z = 0 galaxies. We find that galaxy descendants do not evolve in the same way as galaxy progenitors, largely due to scatter in mass accretion histories. We also provide estimates for the 1sigma range of cumulative number densities corresponding to galaxy progenitors and descendants. Finally, we discuss some limits on cumulative number density comparisons, which arise due to difficulties measuring physical quantities (e.g., stellar mass) consistently across redshifts. A public tool to calculate cumulative number density evolution for galaxies, as well as approximate halo masses, is available online.},

@article{Baldry:2008aa,
	Abstract = {A comparison between published field galaxy stellar mass functions (GSMFs) shows that the cosmic stellar mass density is in the range 4-8 per cent of the baryon density (assuming Omegab = 0.045). There remain significant sources of uncertainty for the dust correction and underlying stellar mass-to-light ratio even assuming a reasonable universal stellar initial mass function. We determine the z < 0.05 GSMF using the New York University Value-Added Galaxy Catalog sample of 49968 galaxies derived from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and various estimates of stellar mass. The GSMF shows clear evidence for a low-mass upturn and is fitted with a double Schechter function that has alpha2 ~= -1.6. At masses below ~108.5Msolar, the GSMF may be significantly incomplete because of missing low-surface-brightness galaxies. One interpretation of the stellar mass-metallicity relation is that it is primarily caused by a lower fraction of available baryons converted to stars in low-mass galaxies. Using this principle, we determine a simple relationship between baryonic mass and stellar mass and present an `implied baryonic mass function'. This function has a faint-end slope, alpha2 ~= -1.9. Thus, we find evidence that the slope of the low-mass end of the galaxy mass function could plausibly be as steep as the halo mass function. We illustrate the relationship between halo baryonic mass function -> galaxy baryonic mass function -> GSMF. This demonstrates the requirement for peak galaxy formation efficiency at baryonic masses ~1011Msolar corresponding to a minimum in feedback effects. The baryonic-infall efficiency may have levelled off at lower masses.},

	Abstract = {We examine a sample of low-redshift (10 h-1 Mpc<d<150 h-1 Mpc) field galaxies including galaxies with luminosities as low as Mr-5logh~-12.5, selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 2 (SDSS DR2). The sample is unique in containing galaxies of extremely low luminosities in a wide range of environments, selected with uniform and well-understood criteria. We present the luminosity function, as well as the broadband properties, of low-luminosity galaxies in this sample. A Schechter function is an insufficient parameterization of the r-band luminosity function; there is an upturn in the slope for Mr-5logh>-18. The resulting slope at low luminosities in this sample is alpha2~-1.3. However, we almost certainly miss a large number of galaxies at very low luminosities due to low surface brightness selection effects, and we estimate that the true low-luminosity slope may be as steep as or steeper than alpha2~-1.5. The results here are consistent with previous SDSS results and, in the g band, roughly consistent with the results of the Two Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey. Extremely low luminosity galaxies are predominantly low surface brightness, exponential disks, the majority of which are red.  Based on observations obtained with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.},

	Abstract = {The GALEX mission of NASA, is collecting an unprecedent set of astronomical UV data in the far and the near UV range. The telescope measures the full sky in a continuous automatic scan. Knowing the attitude data, local images are simultaneously extracted and corrected for smearing and instrumental effects. Final UV images show, by far, a lower resolution than their visible counterpart. It originates blends, ambiguities and missidentifications of the astronomical sources. Our purpose is to deduce from the UV image the UV photometry of the visible objets through a bayesian approach, using the visible data (catalog and image) as the starting reference for the UV analysis. For the feasibility reasons as the deep field images are very large, a segmentation procedure has been defined to manage the analysis in a tractable form. The present paper discusses all these aspects and details the full method and performances.},

@article{Jarrett:2000aa,
	Abstract = {The Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) will observe over 1,000,000 galaxies and extended Galactic sources covering the entire sky at wavelengths between 1 and 2 mum. Most of these galaxies will be newly cataloged objects. The survey catalog will have both high completeness and reliability down to J=15.0 mag and Ks=13.5 mag, equivalent to 1.6 and 2.9 mJy, respectively. Galaxies as small as 10" are resolved, and those as large as ~2.5' are fully imaged. 2MASS will discover galaxies never seen before in the ``zone of avoidance'' caused by the obscuring effects of Galactic dust and gas, limited only by the extreme number of stars at very low Galactic latitude, especially toward the Galactic center. This paper describes the basic algorithms used to detect and characterize extended sources in the 2MASS database and catalog. Critical procedures include tracking the point-spread function, image background removal, artifact removal, photometry and basic parameterization, star-galaxy discrimination, and object classification using a decision tree technique. We introduce and provide examples of the types of extended sources that 2MASS detects across the sky, including galaxies, Galactic nebulae and resolved stellar objects, multiple stars and clusters, and, finally, artifacts arising from bright stars and transient events. A future paper will provide a full statistical analysis and verification of the completeness, reliability, and integrity of the first release catalog, as well as some of the basic scientific results of the catalog, including galaxy colors, number counts, and redshift distribution.},

	Abstract = {Here we present the New York University Value-Added Galaxy Catalog (NYU-VAGC), a catalog of local galaxies (mostly below z~0.3) based on a set of publicly released surveys matched to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 2. The photometric catalog consists of 693,319 galaxies, QSOs, and stars; 343,568 of these have redshift determinations, mostly from the SDSS. Excluding areas masked by bright stars, the photometric sample covers 3514 deg2, and the spectroscopic sample covers 2627 deg2 (with about 85% completeness). Earlier, proprietary versions of this catalog have formed the basis of many SDSS investigations of the power spectrum, correlation function, and luminosity function of galaxies. Future releases will follow future public releases of the SDSS. The catalog includes matches to the Two Micron All Sky Survey Point Source Catalog and Extended Source Catalog, the IRAS Point Source Catalog Redshift Survey, the Two-Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey, the Third Reference Catalogue of Bright Galaxies, and the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty cm survey. We calculate and compile derived quantities from the images and spectra of the galaxies in the catalogs (for example, K-corrections and structural parameters for the galaxies). The SDSS catalog presented here is photometrically calibrated in a more consistent way than that distributed by the SDSS Data Release 2 Archive Servers and is thus more appropriate for large-scale structure statistics, reducing systematic calibration errors across the sky from ~2% to ~1%. We include an explicit description of the geometry of the catalog, including all imaging and targeting information as a function of sky position. Finally, we have performed eyeball quality checks on a large number of objects in the catalog in order to flag errors (such as errors in deblending). This catalog is complementary to the SDSS Archive Servers in that NYU-VAGC's calibration, geometric description, and conveniently small size are specifically designed for studying galaxy properties and large-scale structure statistics using the SDSS spectroscopic catalog.

	Abstract = {This paper describes the Seventh Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), marking the completion of the original goals of the SDSS and the end of the phase known as SDSS-II. It includes 11,663 deg2 of imaging data, with most of the ~2000 deg2 increment over the previous data release lying in regions of low Galactic latitude. The catalog contains five-band photometry for 357 million distinct objects. The survey also includes repeat photometry on a 120$\,^{\circ}$ long, 2fdg5 wide stripe along the celestial equator in the Southern Galactic Cap, with some regions covered by as many as 90 individual imaging runs. We include a co-addition of the best of these data, going roughly 2 mag fainter than the main survey over 250 deg2. The survey has completed spectroscopy over 9380 deg2 the spectroscopy is now complete over a large contiguous area of the Northern Galactic Cap, closing the gap that was present in previous data releases. There are over 1.6 million spectra in total, including 930,000 galaxies, 120,000 quasars, and 460,000 stars. The data release includes improved stellar photometry at low Galactic latitude. The astrometry has all been recalibrated with the second version of the USNO CCD Astrograph Catalog, reducing the rms statistical errors at the bright end to 45 milliarcseconds per coordinate. We further quantify a systematic error in bright galaxy photometry due to poor sky determination; this problem is less severe than previously reported for the majority of galaxies. Finally, we describe a series of improvements to the spectroscopic reductions, including better flat fielding and improved wavelength calibration at the blue end, better processing of objects with extremely strong narrow emission lines, and an improved determination of stellar metallicities.},

	Abstract = {We review recent determinations of the present-day mass function (PDMF) and initial mass function (IMF) in various components of the Galaxy-disk, spheroid, young, and globular clusters-and in conditions characteristic of early star formation. As a general feature, the IMF is found to depend weakly on the environment and to be well described by a power-law form for m>~1 Msolar and a lognormal form below, except possibly for early star formation conditions. The disk IMF for single objects has a characteristic mass around mc~0.08 Msolar and a variance in logarithmic mass sigma~0.7, whereas the IMF for multiple systems has mc~0.2 Msolar and sigma~0.6. The extension of the single MF into the brown dwarf regime is in good agreement with present estimates of L- and T-dwarf densities and yields a disk brown dwarf number density comparable to the stellar one, nBD~n*~0.1 pc-3. The IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk field IMF, providing the same correction for unresolved binaries, confirming the fact that young star clusters and disk field stars represent the same stellar population. Dynamical effects, yielding depletion of the lowest mass objects, are found to become consequential for ages >~130 Myr. The spheroid IMF relies on much less robust grounds. The large metallicity spread in the local subdwarf photometric sample, in particular, remains puzzling. Recent observations suggest that there is a continuous kinematic shear between the thick-disk population, present in local samples, and the genuine spheroid one. This enables us to derive only an upper limit for the spheroid mass density and IMF. Within all the uncertainties, the latter is found to be similar to the one derived for globular clusters and is well represented also by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the disk, mc~0.2-0.3 Msolar, excluding a significant population of brown dwarfs in globular clusters and in the spheroid. The IMF characteristic of early star formation at large redshift remains undetermined, but different observational constraints suggest that it does not extend below ~1 Msolar. These results suggest a characteristic mass for star formation that decreases with time, from conditions prevailing at large redshift to conditions characteristic of the spheroid (or thick disk) to present-day conditions. These conclusions, however, remain speculative, given the large uncertainties in the spheroid and early star IMF determinations.  These IMFs allow a reasonably robust determination of the Galactic present-day and initial stellar and brown dwarf contents. They also have important galactic implications beyond the Milky Way in yielding more accurate mass-to-light ratio determinations. The mass-to-light ratios obtained with the disk and the spheroid IMF yield values 1.8-1.4 times smaller than for a Salpeter IMF, respectively, in agreement with various recent dynamical determinations. This general IMF determination is examined in the context of star formation theory. None of the theories based on a Jeans-type mechanism, where fragmentation is due only to gravity, can fulfill all the observational constraints on star formation and predict a large number of substellar objects. On the other hand, recent numerical simulations of compressible turbulence, in particular in super-Alfv{\'e}nic conditions, seem to reproduce both qualitatively and quantitatively the stellar and substellar IMF and thus provide an appealing theoretical foundation. In this picture, star formation is induced by the dissipation of large-scale turbulence to smaller scales through radiative MHD shocks, producing filamentary structures. These shocks produce local nonequilibrium structures with large density contrasts, which collapse eventually in gravitationally bound objects under the combined influence of turbulence and gravity. The concept of a single Jeans mass is replaced by a distribution of local Jeans masses, representative of the lognormal probability density function of the turbulent gas. Objects below the mean thermal Jeans mass still have a possibility to collapse, although with a decreasing probability.  The page charges for this Review were partially covered by a generous gift from a PASP supporter.},

	Abstract = {FSPS is a flexible SPS package that allows the user to compute simple stellar populations (SSPs) for a range of IMFs and metallicities, and for a variety of assumptions regarding the morphology of the horizontal branch, the blue straggler population, the post--AGB phase, and the location in the HR diagram of the TP-AGB phase. From these SSPs the user may then generate composite stellar populations (CSPs) for a variety of star formation histories (SFHs) and dust attenuation prescriptions. Outputs include the `observed' spectra and magnitudes of the SSPs and CSPs at arbitrary redshift. In addition to these fortran routines, several IDL routines are provided that allow easy manipulation of the output. FSPS was designed with the intention that the user would make full use of the provided fortran routines. However, the full FSPS package is quite large, and requires some time for the user to become familiar with all of the options and syntax. Some users may only need SSPs for a range of metallicities and IMFs. For such users, standard SSP sets for several IMFs, evolutionary tracks, and spectral libraries are available here.},

	Abstract = {We give an overview of the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX), a NASA Explorer Mission launched on 2003 April 28. GALEX is performing the first space UV sky survey, including imaging and grism surveys in two bands (1350-1750 and 1750-2750 {\AA}). The surveys include an all-sky imaging survey (mAB~=20.5), a medium imaging survey of 1000 deg2 (mAB~=23), a deep imaging survey of 100 deg2 (mAB~=25), and a nearby galaxy survey. Spectroscopic (slitless) grism surveys (R=100-200) are underway with various depths and sky coverage. Many targets overlap existing or planned surveys in other bands. We will use the measured UV properties of local galaxies, along with corollary observations, to calibrate the relationship of the UV and global star formation rate in local galaxies. We will apply this calibration to distant galaxies discovered in the deep imaging and spectroscopic surveys to map the history of star formation in the universe over the redshift range 0<z<2 and probe the physical drivers of star formation in galaxies. The GALEX mission includes a guest investigator program, supporting the wide variety of programs made possible by the first UV sky survey.},

	Abstract = {We measure the evolution of the stellar mass function (SMF) from z = 0-1 using multi-wavelength imaging and spectroscopic redshifts from the PRism MUlti-object Survey (PRIMUS) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). From PRIMUS we construct an i < 23 flux-limited sample of ~40, 000 galaxies at z = 0.2-1.0 over five fields totaling ≈5.5 deg2, and from the SDSS we select ~170, 000 galaxies at z = 0.01-0.2 that we analyze consistently with respect to PRIMUS to minimize systematic errors in our evolutionary measurements. We find that the SMF of all galaxies evolves relatively little since z = 1, although we do find evidence for mass assembly downsizing; we measure a ≈30% increase in the number density of ~1010  {M}_{\odot } galaxies since z ≈ 0.6, and a <~ 10% change in the number density of all >~ 1011  {M}_{\odot } galaxies since z ≈ 1. Dividing the sample into star-forming and quiescent using an evolving cut in specific star formation rate, we find that the number density of ~1010  {M}_{\odot } star-forming galaxies stays relatively constant since z ≈ 0.6, whereas the space density of >~ 1011  {M}_{\odot } star-forming galaxies decreases by ≈50% between z ≈ 1 and z ≈ 0. Meanwhile, the number density of ~1010  {M}_{\odot } quiescent galaxies increases steeply toward low redshift, by a factor of ~2-3 since z ≈ 0.6, while the number of massive quiescent galaxies remains approximately constant since z ≈ 1. These results suggest that the rate at which star-forming galaxies are quenched increases with decreasing stellar mass, but that the bulk of the stellar mass buildup within the quiescent population occurs around ~1010.8  {M}_{\odot }. In addition, we conclude that mergers do not appear to be a dominant channel for the stellar mass buildup of galaxies at z < 1, even among massive (gsim 1011  {M}_{\odot }) quiescent galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We demonstrate that dwarf galaxies (107 < M stellar < 109 M &sun;, -12 > Mr > -18) with no active star formation are extremely rare (<0.06%) in the field. Our sample is based on the NASA-Sloan Atlas which is a reanalysis of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 8. We examine the relative number of quenched versus star-forming dwarf galaxies, defining quenched galaxies as having no Halpha emission (EWHalpha < 2 {\AA}) and a strong 4000 {\AA} break. The fraction of quenched dwarf galaxies decreases rapidly with increasing distance from a massive host, leveling off for distances beyond 1.5 Mpc. We define galaxies beyond 1.5 Mpc of a massive host galaxy to be in the field. We demonstrate that there is a stellar mass threshold of M stellar < 1.0 × 109 M &sun; below which quenched galaxies do not exist in the field. Below this threshold, we find that none of the 2951 field dwarf galaxies are quenched; all field dwarf galaxies show evidence for recent star formation. Correcting for volume effects, this corresponds to a 1sigma upper limit on the quenched fraction of 0.06%. In more dense environments, quenched galaxies account for 23% of the dwarf population over the same stellar mass range. The majority of quenched dwarf galaxies (often classified as dwarf elliptical galaxies) are within 2 virial radii of a massive galaxy, and only a few percent of quenched dwarf galaxies exist beyond 4 virial radii. Thus, for galaxies with stellar mass less than 1.0 × 109 M &sun;, ending star formation requires the presence of a more massive neighbor, providing a stringent constraint on models of star formation feedback.},

	Abstract = {We review the physical properties of nearby, relatively luminous galaxies, using results from newly available massive data sets together with more detailed observations. First, we present the global distribution of properties, including the optical and ultraviolet (UV) luminosity, stellar mass, and atomic gas mass functions. Second, we describe the shift of the galaxy population from late galaxy types in underdense regions to early galaxy types in overdense regions. We emphasize that the scaling relations followed by each galaxy type change very little with environment, with the exception of some minor but detectable effects. The shift in the population is apparent even at the densities of small groups and therefore cannot be exclusively due to physical processes operating in rich clusters. Third, we divide galaxies into four crude types---spiral, lenticular, elliptical, and merging systems---and describe some of their more detailed properties. We attempt to put these detailed properties into the global context provided by large surveys.},

@article{Casey:2014aa,
	Abstract = {Far-infrared and submillimeter wavelength surveys have now established the important role of dusty, star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) in the assembly of stellar mass and the evolution of massive galaxies in the Universe. The brightest of these galaxies have infrared luminosities in excess of 10$^{13}$ L$_{\odot}$ with implied star-formation rates of thousands of solar masses per year. They represent the most intense starbursts in the Universe, yet many are completely optically obscured. Their easy detection at submm wavelengths is due to dust heated by ultraviolet radiation of newly forming stars. When summed up, all of the dusty, star-forming galaxies in the Universe produce an infrared radiation field that has an equal energy density as the direct starlight emission from all galaxies visible at ultraviolet and optical wavelengths. The bulk of this infrared extragalactic background light emanates from galaxies as diverse as gas-rich disks to mergers of intense starbursting galaxies. Major advances in far-infrared instrumentation in recent years, both space-based and ground-based, has led to the detection of nearly a million DSFGs, yet our understanding of the underlying astrophysics that govern the start and end of the dusty starburst phase is still in nascent stage. This review is aimed at summarizing the current status of DSFG studies, focusing especially on the detailed characterization of the best-understood subset (submillimeter galaxies, who were summarized in the last review of this field over a decade ago, Blain et al., 2002), but also the selection and characterization of more recently discovered DSFG populations. We review DSFG population statistics, their physical properties including dust, gas and stellar contents, their environments, and current theoretical models related to the formation and evolution of these galaxies.},

@article{Drory:2005aa,
	Abstract = {We present a measurement of the evolution of the stellar mass function (MF) of galaxies and the evolution of the total stellar mass density at 0<z<5, extending previous measurements to higher redshift and fainter magnitudes (and lower masses). We use deep multicolor data in the FORS Deep Field (FDF; I-selected reaching IAB~26.8) and the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey-South (GOODS-S)/Chandra Deep Field-South region (K-selected reaching KAB~25.4) to estimate stellar masses based on fits to composite stellar population models for 5557 and 3367 sources, respectively. The MF of objects from the K-selected GOODS-S sample is very similar to that of the I-selected FDF down to the completeness limit of the GOODS-S sample. Near-IR-selected surveys hence detect the more massive objects of the same principal population as do I-selected surveys. We find that the most massive galaxies harbor the oldest stellar populations at all redshifts. At low z, our MF follows the local MF very well, extending the local MF down by a decade to 108 Msolar. Furthermore, the faint-end slope is consistent with the local value of alpha~1.1 at least up to z~1.5. Our MF also agrees very well with the Munich Near-Infrared Cluster Survey and K20 results at z<~2. The MF seems to evolve in a regular way at least up to z~2, with the normalization decreasing by 50% to z=1 and by 70% to z=2. Objects with M>1010 Msolar, which are the likely progenitors of today's L>L* galaxies, are found in much smaller numbers above z~2. However, we note that massive galaxies with M>1011 Msolar are present even to the largest redshift we probe. Beyond z~2, the evolution of the MF becomes more rapid. We find that the total stellar mass density at z=1 is 50% of the local value. At z=2, 25% of the local mass density is assembled, and at z=3 and z=5, we find that at least 15% and 5% of the mass in stars is in place, respectively. The number density of galaxies with M>1011 Msolar evolves very similarly to the evolution at lower masses. It decreases by 0.4 dex to z~1, by 0.6 dex to z~2, and by 1 dex to z~4.},

	Abstract = {We present a formalism to reveal merging by subtracting the change in the galaxy stellar mass function (MF) due to mass-dependent star formation (SF) from the observed time derivative of the MF. We present the SF rate (SFR) in the FORS Deep Field as a function of stellar mass and time spanning 9<logM*<12 and 0<z<5. At z>~3, the average SFR is a power law of stellar mass (M*~M0.6*). The average SFR in massive objects at this redshift is 100-500 Msolar yr-1. At z~3, the SFR starts to drop at high masses. The break mass at which the SFR deviates from the power-law form decreases smoothly from logM1*>~13 at z~5 to logM1*~10.9 at z~0.5, according to M1*(z)=2.7×1010(1+z)2.1 (downsizing). We directly observe a relationship between SF history and mass. More massive galaxies have steeper and earlier onsets of SF, higher peak SFR, followed by a shorter decay time. The SFR in high-mass galaxies at z~4 can explain their rapid increase in abundance. Within large uncertainties, at most 0.8 effective major mergers per Gyr are consistent with the data, yet enough to transform most high-mass objects into ellipticals contemporaneously with their major SF episode. In contrast, at z<1.5 and at M*>~11, mergers contribute 0.1-0.2 Gyr-1 to the increase in number density. This corresponds to ~1 major merger per object a 1.5>z>0. At 10<logM*<11, galaxies are being preferentially destroyed at early times, while at later times the change in their numbers turns positive. This is an indication of the top-down buildup of the red sequence suggested by other recent observations.},

@article{Johnston:2011aa,
	Abstract = {From as early as the 1930s, astronomers have tried to quantify the statistical nature of the evolution and large-scale structure of galaxies by studying their luminosity distribution as a function of redshift---known as the galaxy luminosity function (LF). Accurately constructing the LF remains a popular and yet tricky pursuit in modern observational cosmology where the presence of observational selection effects due to e.g. detection thresholds in apparent magnitude, colour, surface brightness or some combination thereof can render any given galaxy survey incomplete and thus introduce bias into the LF. Over the last 70 years there have been numerous sophisticated statistical approaches devised to tackle these issues; all have advantages---but not one is perfect. This review takes a broad historical look at the key statistical tools that have been developed over this period, discussing their relative merits and highlighting any significant extensions and modifications. In addition, the more generalised methods that have emerged within the last few years are examined. These methods propose a more rigorous statistical framework within which to determine the LF compared to some of the more traditional methods. I also look at how photometric redshift estimations are being incorporated into the LF methodology as well as considering the construction of bivariate LFs. Finally, I review the ongoing development of completeness estimators which test some of the fundamental assumptions going into LF estimators and can be powerful probes of any residual systematic effects inherent magnitude-redshift data.},

@article{Salim:2007aa,
	Abstract = {We measure star formation rates (SFRs) of ~50,000 optically selected galaxies in the local universe (z~0.1)-from gas-rich dwarfs to massive ellipticals. We obtain dust-corrected SFRs by fitting the GALEX (ultraviolet) and SDSS photometry to a library of dust-attenuated population synthesis models. For star-forming galaxies, our UV-based SFRs compare remarkably well with those from SDSS-measured emission lines (Halpha). Deviations from perfect agreement are shown to be due to differences in the dust attenuation estimates. In contrast to Halpha measurements, UV provides reliable SFRs for galaxies with weak Halpha, and where Halpha is contaminated with AGN emission (1/2 of the sample). Using full-SED SFRs, we calibrate a simple prescription that uses GALEX far- and near-UV magnitudes to produce dust-corrected SFRs for normal star-forming galaxies. The specific SFR is considered as a function of stellar mass for (1) star-forming galaxies with no AGNs, (2) those hosting an AGN, and (3) galaxies without Halpha emission. We find that the three have distinct star formation histories, with AGNs lying intermediate between the star-forming and the quiescent galaxies. Star-forming galaxies without an AGN lie on a relatively narrow linear sequence. Remarkably, galaxies hosting a strong AGN appear to represent the massive continuation of this sequence. On the other hand, weak AGNs, while also massive, have lower SFRs, sometimes extending to the realm of quiescent galaxies. We propose an evolutionary sequence for massive galaxies that smoothly connects normal star-forming galaxies to quiescent galaxies via strong and weak AGNs. We confirm that some galaxies with no Halpha show signs of star formation in the UV. We derive a cosmic star formation density at z=0.1 with significantly smaller total error than previous measurements.},

	Abstract = {We analyze star formation (SF) as a function of stellar mass (M*) and redshift z in the All-Wavelength Extended Groth Strip International Survey. For 2905 field galaxies, complete to 1010(1010.8) Msolar at z<0.7(1), with Keck spectroscopic redshifts out to z=1.1, we compile SF rates (SFRs) from emission lines, GALEX, and Spitzer MIPS 24 mum photometry, optical-NIR M* measurements, and HST morphologies. Galaxies with reliable signs of SF form a distinct ``main sequence'' (MS), with a limited range of SFRs at a given M* and z (1 sigma<~+/-0.3 dex), and log(SFR) approximately proportional to logM*. The range of log(SFR) remains constant to z>1, while the MS as a whole moves to higher SFR as z increases. The range of the SFR along the MS constrains the amplitude of episodic variations of SF and the effect of mergers on the SFR. Typical galaxies spend ~67%(95%) of their lifetime since z=1 within a factor of <~2(4) of their average SFR at a given M* and z. The dominant mode of the evolution of SF since z~1 is apparently a gradual decline of the average SFR in most individual galaxies, not a decreasing frequency of starburst episodes, or a decreasing factor by which SFRs are enhanced in starbursts. LIRGs at z~1 seem to mostly reflect the high SFR typical for massive galaxies at that epoch. The smooth MS may reflect that the same set of few physical processes governs SF prior to additional quenching processes. A gradual process like gas exhaustion may play a dominant role.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the relationship between the colors, luminosities, and environments of galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopic sample, using environmental measurements on scales ranging from 0.2 to 6 h-1 Mpc. We find that (1) the relationship between color and environment persists even to the lowest luminosities we probe (Mr-5log10h~-14) (2) at luminosities and colors for which the galaxy correlation function has a large amplitude, it also has a steep slope; and (3) in regions of a given overdensity on small scales (1 h-1 Mpc), the overdensity on large scales (6 h-1 Mpc) does not appear to relate to the recent star formation history of the galaxies. Of these results, the last has the most immediate application to galaxy formation theory. In particular, it lends support to the notion that a galaxy's properties are related only to the mass of its host dark matter halo, and not to the larger scale environment.  Based on observations obtained with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.},

	Abstract = {The 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) is designed to measure redshifts for approximately 250000 galaxies. The 2dFGRS uses the 2dF multifibre spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian Telescope, which is capable of observing 400 objects simultaneously over a 2 degree diameter field. The source catalogue for the survey is a revised and extended version of the APM galaxy catalogue, and the targets are galaxies with extinction-corrected magnitudes brighter than bJ=19.45. The main survey regions are two declination strips, one in the southern Galactic hemisphere spanning 80x15degrees around the South Galactic Pole, and the other in the Northern Galactic hemisphere spanning 75x10degrees along the celestial equator; in addition, there are 99 fields spread over the southern Galactic cap. The survey covers 2000 square degrees and has a median depth of z=0.11. Adaptive tiling is used to give a highly uniform sampling rate of 93% over the whole survey region. The 100k release contains the 102426 objects observed up to 31 January 2001.  Redshifts are measured from spectra covering 3600-8000 Angstroms at a two-pixel resolution of 9.0 Angstrom and a median S/N of 13 per pixel. All redshift identifications are visually checked and assigned a quality parameter Q in the range 1-5; Q>=3 redshifts are 98.4% reliable and have an rms uncertainty of 85 km/s. The overall redshift completeness for Q>=3 redshifts is 91.8% but this varies with magnitude from 99% for the brightest galaxies to 90% for objects at the survey limit.  The 2dFGRS data base is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/2dFGRS.  This catalog was extracted from the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey 100k release CD-ROMs using the included mSQL database. This catalog comprises the basic spectroscopic information from the best spectrum of each object, that is contained in the extnum=0 rows of the mSQL database.  (1 data file).},

	Abstract = {The cold dark matter model has become the leading theoretical picture for the formation of structure in the Universe. This model, together with the theory of cosmic inflation, makes a clear prediction for the initial conditions for structure formation and predicts that structures grow hierarchically through gravitational instability. Testing this model requires that the precise measurements delivered by galaxy surveys can be compared to robust and equally precise theoretical calculations. Here we present a simulation of the growth of dark matter structure using 2,1603 particles, following them from redshift z = 127 to the present in a cube-shaped region 2.230 billion lightyears on a side. In postprocessing, we also follow the formation and evolution of the galaxies and quasars. We show that baryon-induced features in the initial conditions of the Universe are reflected in distorted form in the low-redshift galaxy distribution, an effect that can be used to constrain the nature of dark energy with future generations of observational surveys of galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We use the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey to measure the dependence of the bJ-band galaxy luminosity function on large-scale environment, defined by density contrast in spheres of radius 8h-1 Mpc, and on spectral type, determined from principal component analysis. We find that the galaxy populations at both extremes of density differ significantly from that at the mean density. The population in voids is dominated by late types and shows, relative to the mean, a deficit of galaxies that becomes increasingly pronounced at magnitudes brighter than MbJ-5log10h<~-18.5. In contrast, cluster regions have a relative excess of very bright early-type galaxies with MbJ-5log10h<~-21. Differences in the mid- to faint-end population between environments are significant: at MbJ-5log10h=-18 early- and late-type cluster galaxies show comparable abundances, whereas in voids the late types dominate by almost an order of magnitude. We find that the luminosity functions measured in all density environments, from voids to clusters, can be approximated by Schechter functions with parameters that vary smoothly with local density, but in a fashion that differs strikingly for early- and late-type galaxies. These observed variations, combined with our finding that the faint-end slope of the overall luminosity function depends at most weakly on density environment, may prove to be a significant challenge for models of galaxy formation.},

@article{Muldrew:2012aa,
	Abstract = {The influence of a galaxy's environment on its evolution has been studied and compared extensively in the literature, although differing techniques are often used to define environment. Most methods fall into two broad groups: those that use nearest neighbours to probe the underlying density field and those that use fixed apertures. The differences between the two inhibit a clean comparison between analyses and leave open the possibility that, even with the same data, different properties are actually being measured. In this work, we apply 20 published environment definitions to a common mock galaxy catalogue constrained to look like the local Universe. We find that nearest-neighbour-based measures best probe the internal densities of high-mass haloes, while at low masses the interhalo separation dominates and acts to smooth out local density variations. The resulting correlation also shows that nearest-neighbour galaxy environment is largely independent of dark matter halo mass. Conversely, aperture-based methods that probe superhalo scales accurately identify high-density regions corresponding to high-mass haloes. Both methods show how galaxies in dense environments tend to be redder, with the exception of the largest apertures, but these are the strongest at recovering the background dark matter environment. We also warn against using photometric redshifts to define environment in all but the densest regions. When considering environment, there are two regimes: the 'local environment' internal to a halo best measured with nearest neighbour and 'large-scale environment' external to a halo best measured with apertures. This leads to the conclusion that there is no universal environment measure and the most suitable method depends on the scale being probed.},

	Abstract = {We measure the evolution of the stellar mass function (SMF) from z = 0-1 using multi-wavelength imaging and spectroscopic redshifts from the PRism MUlti-object Survey (PRIMUS) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). From PRIMUS we construct an i < 23 flux-limited sample of ~40, 000 galaxies at z = 0.2-1.0 over five fields totaling ≈5.5 deg2, and from the SDSS we select ~170, 000 galaxies at z = 0.01-0.2 that we analyze consistently with respect to PRIMUS to minimize systematic errors in our evolutionary measurements. We find that the SMF of all galaxies evolves relatively little since z = 1, although we do find evidence for mass assembly downsizing; we measure a ≈30% increase in the number density of ~1010  {M}_{\odot } galaxies since z ≈ 0.6, and a <~ 10% change in the number density of all >~ 1011  {M}_{\odot } galaxies since z ≈ 1. Dividing the sample into star-forming and quiescent using an evolving cut in specific star formation rate, we find that the number density of ~1010  {M}_{\odot } star-forming galaxies stays relatively constant since z ≈ 0.6, whereas the space density of >~ 1011  {M}_{\odot } star-forming galaxies decreases by ≈50% between z ≈ 1 and z ≈ 0. Meanwhile, the number density of ~1010  {M}_{\odot } quiescent galaxies increases steeply toward low redshift, by a factor of ~2-3 since z ≈ 0.6, while the number of massive quiescent galaxies remains approximately constant since z ≈ 1. These results suggest that the rate at which star-forming galaxies are quenched increases with decreasing stellar mass, but that the bulk of the stellar mass buildup within the quiescent population occurs around ~1010.8  {M}_{\odot }. In addition, we conclude that mergers do not appear to be a dominant channel for the stellar mass buildup of galaxies at z < 1, even among massive (gsim 1011  {M}_{\odot }) quiescent galaxies.},

@article{Pozzetti:2010aa,
	Abstract = {We present the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) to redshift z ~= 1, based on the analysis of about 8500 galaxies with I < 22.5 (AB mag) over 1.4 deg2, which are part of the zCOSMOS-bright 10k spectroscopic sample. We investigate the total GSMF, as well as the contributions of early- and late-type galaxies (ETGs and LTGs, respectively), defined by different criteria (broad-band spectral energy distribution, morphology, spectral properties, or star formation activities). We unveil a galaxy bimodality in the global GSMF, whose shape is more accurately represented by 2 Schechter functions, one linked to the ETG and the other to the LTG populations. For the global population, we confirm a mass-dependent evolution (``mass-assembly downsizing''), i.e., galaxy number density increases with cosmic time by a factor of two between z = 1 and z = 0 for intermediate-to-low mass (log (M/M&sun;) ~ 10.5) galaxies but less than 15% for log(M/M&sun;) > 11. We find that the GSMF evolution at intermediate-to-low values of M (log (M/M&sun;) < 10.6) is mostly explained by the growth in stellar mass driven by smoothly decreasing star formation activities, despite the redder colours predicted in particular at low redshift. The low residual evolution is consistent, on average, with ~0.16 merger per galaxy per Gyr (of which fewer than 0.1 are major), with a hint of a decrease with cosmic time but not a clear dependence on the mass. From the analysis of different galaxy types, we find that ETGs, regardless of the classification method, increase in number density with cosmic time more rapidly with decreasing M, i.e., follow a top-down building history, with a median ``building redshift'' increasing with mass (z > 1 for log(M/M&sun;) > 11), in contrast to hierarchical model predictions. For LTGs, we find that the number density of blue or spiral galaxies with log(M/M&sun;) > 10 remains almost constant with cosmic time from z ~ 1. Instead, the most extreme population of star-forming galaxies (with high specific star formation), at intermediate/high-mass, rapidly decreases in number density with cosmic time. Our data can be interpreted as a combination of different effects. Firstly, we suggest a transformation, driven mainly by SFH, from blue, active, spiral galaxies of intermediate mass to blue quiescent and subsequently (1-2 Gyr after) red, passive types of low specific star formation. We find an indication that the complete morphological transformation, probably driven by dynamical processes, into red spheroidal galaxies, occurred on longer timescales or followed after 1-2 Gyr. A continuous replacement of blue galaxies is expected to be accomplished by low-mass active spirals increasing their stellar mass. We estimate the growth rate in number and mass density of the red galaxies at different redshifts and masses. The corresponding fraction of blue galaxies that, at any given time, is transforming into red galaxies per Gyr, due to the quenching of their SFR, is on average ~25% for log(M/M&sun;) < 11. We conclude that the build-up of galaxies and in particular of ETGs follows the same downsizing trend with mass (i.e. occurs earlier for high-mass galaxies) as the formation of their stars and follows the converse of the trend predicted by current SAMs. In this scenario, we expect there to be a negligible evolution of the galaxy baryonic mass function (GBMF) for the global population at all masses and a decrease with cosmic time in the GBMF for the blue galaxy population at intermediate-high masses.

The redshift distribution peaks at z ~ 0.6 and extends to z = 1.2 for galaxies and z = 5 for broad-line active galactic nuclei. The motivation, observational techniques, fields, target selection, slitmask design, and observations are presented here, with a brief summary of the redshift precision; a forthcoming paper presents the data reduction, redshift fitting, redshift confidence, and survey completeness. PRIMUS is the largest faint galaxy survey undertaken to date. The high targeting fraction (~80%) and large survey size will allow for precise measures of galaxy properties and large-scale structure to z ~ 1.},

@article{Cool:2013aa,
	Abstract = {The PRIsm MUlti-object Survey (PRIMUS) is a spectroscopic galaxy redshift survey to z ~ 1 completed with a low-dispersion prism and slitmasks allowing for simultaneous observations of ~2500 objects over 0.18 deg2. The final PRIMUS catalog includes ~130,000 robust redshifts over 9.1 deg2. In this paper, we summarize the PRIMUS observational strategy and present the data reduction details used to measure redshifts, redshift precision, and survey completeness. The survey motivation, observational techniques, fields, target selection, slitmask design, and observations are presented in Coil et al. Comparisons to existing higher-resolution spectroscopic measurements show a typical precision of sigma z /(1 + z) = 0.005. PRIMUS, both in area and number of redshifts, is the largest faint galaxy redshift survey completed to date and is allowing for precise measurements of the relationship between active galactic nuclei and their hosts, the effects of environment on galaxy evolution, and the build up of galactic systems over the latter half of cosmic history.},
