Nevertheless, the evolution of the role of environment is a relatively subtle effect and difficult to study. Although the history of galaxies prior to $z \sim 1$ appears to have been one of rapid assembly, since that time the galaxy population has continued to evolve, but less dramatically. For instance, the major classes of galaxies we observe today, star-forming galaxies that form a tight sequence in SFR for 
given mass and quiescent galaxies with substantially lower SFRs
that form the red color-magnitude sequence, 
have existed at z \sim 1. However, the evolution of luminosity 
and stellar mass functions since then suggest that there has been 
a significant decline in the number density of luminous/massive 
star-forming galaxies accompanied by an increase in the number 
density of  quiescent galaxies (SMF Paper citations). 


While we detect the dependence of galaxy properties to with lower star-formation rate early-type galaxies popu- lating the denser regions (Cooper et al. 2008; Patel et al. 2009; KovaË‡c et al. 2010a)

Although not as dramatic as the evolution since z \sim 2, 
since z \sim 1 there has been a drastic decline in the 
number density of luminous blue galaxies  



Talk about how the red sequence increases as star-forming galaxies cease their star-formation and move to the red sequence. (SMF paper citations) 
Briefly mention the green valley?
