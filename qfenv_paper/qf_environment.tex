\title{PRIMUS: Galaxy Environment on the Quiescent Fraction Evolution at $z < 1$}
\author{ChangHoon Hahn, Michael Blanton, Alison Coil, Richard Cool, Daniel Eisenstein, John Moustakas, Ken Wong, Guangtun Zhu}

\begin{abstract}
We investigate the effects of galaxy environment on the evolution of the quiescent fraction ($f_{\rm{Q}}$) from $z =0.8 $ to $ 0.0$ using spectroscopic redshifts and multi-wavelength imaging data from PRism MUlti-object Survey (PRIMUS) and the Sloan Digitial Sky Survey (SDSS). Our stellar mass limited galaxy sample consists of $\sim 40000$ PRIMUS galaxies within $z = 0.2-0.8$ and $\sim 130000$ SDSS galaxies within $z = 0.0375-0.145$. We classify the galaxies as quiescent or star-forming, based on an evolving specific star formation cut, and as low or high density environments, based on fixed cylindrical aperture environment measurements on a volume-limited {\em Environment Definition Population} (from PRIMUS and SDSS). For each of these subsamples, we examine the stellar mass function (SMF) evolution and compute the $f_{\rm{Q}}(\mathcal{M}_{*})$. We find that in both low and high density environments the quiescent fraction increases with cosmic time over the probed redshift range. Moreover, the difference between the quiescent fraction in low and high density environments remains constant throughout the redshift range. These results suggest that the evolution of the quiescent fraction is independent of environment and provide constraints on quenching mechanisms in high density environments such as groups and clusters.

\section{Introduction}
Galaxies, in their detailed properties, carry the imprints of their
surroundings, with a strong dependence of the quiescent fraction of
galaxies on their local environment (e.g. \citealt{hubble36a,
oemler74a, dressler80a, hermit96a, guzzo97a}; for a recent review see
\citealt{blanton09a}).  The strength of this dependence is itself a
strongly decreasing function of galaxy stellar mass; at the extreme,
the lowest masses ($<10^{9}$ $M_\odot$) galaxies are quenched only in
dense regions, and never in isolation (\citealt{geha12a}).  These
effects vary with redshift at least in the densest clusters, as
observed in the changing fraction of late-type spirals relative to the
field found in studies of the morphology-density relation
(\citealt{dressler84a, desai07a}).  Clearly understanding the
properties of galaxies in the present-day universe requires a careful
investigation of the role of environment, and how that role changes
over time.

Nevertheless, the evolution of the role of environment is a relatively
subtle effect and difficult to study.  Although history of galaxies
prior to $z\sim 1$ appears to have been one of rapid assembly, since
that time the galaxy population has continued to evolve, but less
dramatically. Although there are detectable changes in the population,
the major classes of galaxies existed at $z\sim 1$, in roughly the
same relative numbers as today (\citealt{bundy06a, borch06a,
taylor09a, moustakas13a}. Furthermore, at those redshifts we can also
detect the dependence of galaxy properties on environment, with lower
star-formation rate early-type galaxies populating the denser regions
(\citealt{cooper08a, patel09a, kovac10a}).

The most dramatic change in galaxy properties during the past eight
billion years has been a remarkable decline in the star-formation rate
of galaxies in the Universe (\citealt{hopkins06a}).  This decline
appears dominated by decreases in the rates of star-formation of
individual galaxies (\cite{Noeske:2007aa}). There is evidence that a
large fraction of the decline associated with strongly
infrared-emitting starbursts (\citealt{bell05a, magnelli09a}).  The
decline does not appear to be due to the quenching of a large
fractions of the star-forming population, as reflected in observations
of the stellar mass function of quiescent and star-forming galaxies
(\cite{Blanton:2006aa},\citealt{bundy06a, borch06a, moustakas13a}).  These
findings leave little room for the participation of
environmentally-driven quenching in the global census of
star-formation.  As \citet{cooper08a} and others have pointed out,
because the environmental dependence of total star-formation rates at
fixed redshift is relatively small, environmentally effects are
unlikely to cause the overall star-formation rate decline.

Thus, the impact of environment on galaxy formation has to be
interpreted on top of the background of this overall decline affecting
galaxies in all environments.  The most straightforward investigation
of would directly determine the star-forming properties of galaxies as
a function of environment, stellar mass and redshift in a single,
consistently analyzed data set. This analysis can reveal how galaxies
are quenched in the universe over time, quantitatively establish the
contribution of environmental effects to the overall trends, and
reveal whether those trends happen equally in all environments.
However, such an analysis has not been done previously due to the lack
of sufficiently large samples. In this paper, we apply this approach
using the Prism Multi-object Survey (PRIMUS; \cite{Coil:2011aa}, 
\cite{Cool:2013aa}), the largest available redshift survey covering the epochs
between $0<z<1$.

In Section \ref{sec:sample}, we present 
%%% INCLUDE OUTLINE OF PAPER 

\section{Sample Selection} \label{sec:sample}
We are interested in quantifying the effects of galaxy environment on the evolution of the quiescent fraction over the redshift range $ z < 1.0$. For our analysis, we require a sample with sufficient depth to probe the redshift range and robust redshifts to measure galaxy environment. PRIMUS, with its $\sim 120,000$ spectroscopic redshifts provides ideal data at intermediate redshifts for our analysis. In addition, we anchor our analysis of the intermediate redshift sample with a low redshift sample derived from SDSS. 

In Section \ref{sec:primus} and Section \ref{sec:sdss} we provide a brief summary of the PRIMUS data and the SDSS data used for our sample selection. Then in Section \ref{sec:target} we define our stellar mass complete target galaxy population. Afterwards, in Section \ref{sec:sfq}, we classify our sample galaxies as quiescent or star-forming then calculate the environment using a volume-limited {\em Environment Defining Population} in Section \ref{sec:environment}. 
Finally in Section \ref{sec:edgeeffect}, we correct our galaxy sample and environment measurements for edge effects of the surveys. 

\subsection{PRIMUS} \label{sec:primus}
For our sample at intermediate redshifts we use multiwavelength imaging and spectroscopic redshifts from PRIMUS, a faint galaxy survey with $\sim 120,000$ precise spectroscopic redshifts ($\sigma_z/(1+z) \approx 0.5 \%$) within the range $z \approx 0-1.2$. The survey was conducted using a IMACS spectrograph on a Magellan I Baade $6.5$ m telescope with a slitmask and low dispersion prism. For details on the PRIMUS observation methods such as survey design, targeting, and data summary, we refer readers to the survey papers: \cite{Coil:2011aa} and \cite{Cool:2013aa}. 

While the PRIMUS survey targeted seven distinct extragalactic deep fields for a total of $\sim 9 \; \rm{deg}^2$, we restrict our sample to five fields that have $GALEX$ and {\em Spitzer}/IRAC imaging (similar to the sample selection in \cite{Moustakas:2013aa}). Four of these fields are a part of the {\em Spitzer} Wide-area Infrared Extragalactic Survey (SWIRE\footnote{http://swire.ipac.caltech.edu/swire/swire.html} ): the European Large Area ISO Survey - South $1$ field (ELAIS-S1\footnote{http://dipastro.pd.astro.it/esis}), the Chanddra Deep Field South SWIRE field (CDFS), and the XMM Large Scale Structure Survey field (XMM-LSS). The XMM-LSS consists of two separate but spatially adjacent fields: the Subaru/XMM-Newton DEEP Survey fied (XMM-SXDSS\footnote{http://www.naoj.org/cience/SubaruProject/SDS}) and the Canadian-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey field (XMM-CFHTLS\footnote{http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/Science/CFHLS}). Our fifth and final field is the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS\footnote{http://cosmos.astro.caltech.edu}) field. For all of our fields we have near-UV (NUV) and far-UV (FUV) photometry from the {\em GALEX} Deep Imaging Survey (DIS; \cite{Martin:2005aa}; \cite{Morrissey:2005aa}) as well as ground-based optical and {\em Spitzer}/IRAC mid-infrared photometric catalogs. \cite{Moustakas:2013aa} provides detailed descriptions of integrated flux calculations in the photometric bands for each of our fields. 

Finally, from the spectroscopic redshift and broad wavelength photometry we use \texttt{iSEDfit}, a Bayesian SED modeling code, to calculate stellar masses and star formation rates (SFRs) for our sample galaxies. \texttt{iSEDfit}, uses the redshift and the observed photometry of the galaxies to determine the statistical likelihood of a large ensemble of generated model SEDs. The model SEDs are generated using Flexible Stellar Population Synthesis (FSPS) models (\cite{Conroy:2010aa}) based on \cite{Chabrier:2003aa} IMF, along with other prior parameters beyond the scope of this paper. For details we refer readers to Section 4.1 and Appendix A. of \cite{Moustakas:2013aa}. For the observed photometry, we use the {\em GALEX} FUV and NUV, the two shortest IRAC bands at $3.6$ and $4.5 \mu \rm{m}$ (the two longer-wavelength IRAC channels are excluded because \texttt{iSEDfit} does not model hot dust or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons emission lines), and the optical bands.

\end{figure*}

\subsection{SDSS-GALEX} \label{sec:sdss}
For our low redshift sample, we use spectroscopic redshifts and high fidelity $ugriz$ photometry from the SDSS Data Release 7 (DR7; \cite{Abazajian:2009aa}). More specifically we select galaxies from the New York University Value-Added Galaxy Catalog (SDSS VAGC) that satisfy the main sample criterion and have galaxy extinction corrected Petrosian magnitudes $14.5 < r < 17.6$ and spectroscopic redshifts within $0.01 < z < 0.2$ (\cite{Blanton:2005aa}). We further narrow down the SDSS VAGC sample to only galaxies with medium depth observations with total exposure time greater than $1 \; \rm{ks}$ from {\em GALEX} Release 6. This SDSS-{\em GALEX} sample contains $167,727$ galaxies. 

Using the MAST/CasJobs\footnote{http://galex.stsci.edu/casjobs} interface and a $4''$ diameter search radius, we obtain the NUV and FNU photometry for the SDSS-{\em GALEX} galaxies. For optical photometry, we use the $ugriz$ bands from the SDSS \texttt{model} magnitudes scaled to the $r$-band \texttt{cmodel} magnitude. These photometric bands are then supplemented with integrated $JHK_s$ magnitudes from the 2MASS Extended Source Catalog (XSC; \cite{Jarrett:2000aa}) and with photometry at $3.4$ and $4.6 \mu \rm{m}$ from the WISE All-Sky Data Release\footnote{http://wise2.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/release/allsky}. Further details regarding the SDSS-{\em GALEX} sample photometry can be found in Section 2.4 of \cite{Moustakas:2013aa}. As we did with the PRIMUS data above, we use \texttt{iSEDfit} with the above observed photometry to obtain the stellar masses and star formation rates for the SDSS-{\em GALEX} sample. 

\subsection{Galaxy Sample} \label{sec:target} 
Using the low redshift SDSS-{\em GALEX} and intermediate redshift PRIMUS data described above, in this section, we define our galaxy sample which will be used to compute the SMFs and QFs. For PRIMUS, we begin with the selection criteria imposed in \cite{Moustakas:2013aa} for their parent sample. We take the statistically complete {\em primary} sample from the PRIMUS data (\cite{Coil:2011aa}) and impose magnitude limits on optical selection bands as specified in \cite{Moustakas:2013aa} Table 1. These limits are in different optical selection bands and have distinct values for the five PRIMUS target fields. We then exclude stars and broad-line AGN to only select objects spectroscopically classified as galaxies, with high-quality spectroscopic redshifts ($Q \geq 3$). In addition we impose a redshift range of $ 0.2 < z < 0.8$ for the PRIMUS galaxy sample, where $ z > 0.2$ is selected due to limitations from sample variance and $ z < 0.8$ is selected due to the lack of sufficient statistics in subsamples defined below. 

For the PRIMUS objects that meet the above criteria, we assign statistical weights (described in \cite{Coil:2011aa} and \cite{Cool:2013aa}) in order to correct for targeting incompleteness and redshift failures. The statistical weight, $w_i$, for each galaxy is given by
\begin{equation}
w_{i} = (f_{\rm{target}} \times f_{\rm{collision}} \times f_{\rm{success}})^{-1},
\end{equation}
Equation (1) in \cite{Moustakas:2013aa}. Given that our ultimate interest is in deriving the SMFs and QFs from our sample, we impose stellar mass limits in order to derive a stellar mass complete galaxy sample. 

Stellar mass completeness limits for a magnitude-limited survey such as PRIMUS is a function of redshift, the apparent magnitude limit of the survey, and the typical stellar mass-to-light ratio of galaxies near the flux limit. As done in \cite{Moustakas:2013aa}, we follow \cite{Pozzetti:2010aa} to empirically determine the stellar mass completeness limits. For each of the target galaxies we compute $\mathcal{M}_{\rm{lim}}$ using $\rm{log} \; \mathcal{M}_{\rm{lim}} = \rm{log} \; \mathcal{M} + 0.4 ( m - m_{\rm{lim}})$, where $\mathcal{M}$ is the stellar mass of the galaxy in $\mathcal{M_{\odot}}$, $\mathcal{M}_{\rm{lim}}$ is the stellar mass of each galaxy if its magnitude was equal to the survey magnitude limit, $m$ is observed apparent magnitude in the selection band, and $m_{\rm{lim}}$ is the magnitude limit for our five fields mentioned above. We construct a cumulative distribution of $\mathcal{M}_{\rm{lim}}$ for the $15\%$ faintest galaxies in $\Delta z=0.04$ bins. In each of these redshift bins, we calculate the minimum stellar mass that includes $95 \%$ of the galaxies. Separately for quiescent and star-forming galaxies, we fit quadratic polynomials to the minimum stellar masses versus redshift (galaxies are classified into star-forming or quiescent in the following section). Finally, we use the polynomials to obtain the minimum stellar masses at the center of redshift bins, $0.2-0.4$, $0.4-0.6$, and $0.6-0.8$, which are then used as PRIMUS stellar mass completeness limits.

To derive the low redshift portion of our galaxy sample, we start by limiting the SDSS-{\em GALEX} data to objects within $0.0375 < z < 0.145$, a redshift range later imposed on the volume-limited Environment Defining Population (Section \ref{sec:environment}). To account for the targeting incompleteness of the SDSS-{\em GALEX} sample, we use the statistical weight estimates provided by the NYU-VAGC catalog. Furthermore, to derive a stellar mass complete sample, we impose a uniform stellar mass limit of $10^9.8 \; \mathcal{M}_{\odot}$, which is determined from the mass-to-light ratio completeness limit of the SDSS-{\em GALEX} sample within the imposed redshift limit. 

The absolute magnitude ($M_{r}$) versus redshift for the galaxy sample (black squares) is plotted in Figure \ref{fig:targetEDP}. The left-most panel corresponds to the target sample derived from the SDSS-{\em GALEX} data and the rest correspond to the target sample derived from the PRIMUS data divided in bins with $\Delta z \sim 0.2$. 

\subsection{Classifying Quiescent and Star-Forming Galaxies} \label{sec:sfq}
With the galaxy sample defined in the previous section, we now classify the galaxies as quiescent or star-forming using an evolving cut based on specific star-formation rate utilized in \cite{Moustakas:2013aa} Section 3.2. This classification method utilizes the star-forming (SF) sequence, which is the correlation between star-formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass in star-forming galaxies observed at least until $z \sim 2$ (\cite{Noeske:2007aa}). The PRIMUS sample displays a well-defined SF sequence within the redshift range of our galaxy sample. Then using the power-law slope for the SF sequence derived by \cite{Salim:2007aa} (SFR $\propto \mathcal{M}^{0.65}$) and the minimum of the quiescent/star-forming bimodality, determined empirically, we obtain the following equation to classify the target galaxies (Equation 2 in \cite{Moustakas:2013aa}):
\begin{equation}
\rm{log}(\rm{SFR}_{\rm{min}}) = -0.49 + 0.64 \rm{log}(\mathcal{M} - 10) +1.07(z-0.1), 
\end{equation} \label{eq:qsfclass} 
where $\mathcal{M}$ is the stellar mass of the galaxy. If the target galaxy SFR and stellar mass lies above Equation \ref{eq:qsfclass} we classify it as star-forming; if below, as quiescent (\cite{Moustakas:2013aa} Figure 1.).

classification based on the cut-offs specified in Table \ref{tab:aperture}. The SMFs use mass bins of 
width $\Delta \rm{log}(\mathcal{M}/\mathcal{M}_{\odot})=0.25$. In each panel we use shades of blue 
(star-forming) and orange (quiescent) to represent the SMF at different redshift, higher redshifts being
progressively lighter.}      \label{fig:smf}
    \end{center}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Galaxy Environment} \label{sec:environment}
In addition to dividing the galaxy sample into quiescent and star-forming galaxies, we also classify the galaxies into high and low density environments.In this section, we measure the environment for our galaxy sample. We define the environment of a galaxy as the number of neighboring galaxies within a fixed aperture centered around it. We use a fixed aperture measurement of environment because, as \cite{Muldrew:2012aa} finds in their comparison of different environment definition using simulations, it provides a better probe of the entire halo in comparison to other environment definitions such as nearest neighbor, which provides a better tracer at inter-halo scales. For our aperture, we use a cylinder of dimensions: $R_{\rm{ap}} = 2 \; \rm{Mpc}/h$ and $H_{\rm{ap}} = 25 \; \rm{Mpc}/h$. Though spherical apertures are often used in literature (e.g. \cite{Croton:2005aa}), we use a cylindrical aperture in order to account for the PRIMUS redshift errors and redshift space distortions (i.e. "Finger of God" effect). \cite{Cooper:2005aa} finds that $\pm 1000 \; \rm{km} \rm{s^{-1}}$ optimally reduces the effects of redshift space distortions and PRIMUS $\sigma_z \sim 0.0085$ at $z \sim 0.7$, so aperture height of $25 \; \rm{Mpc}/h$ successfully accounts for both of these effects. Furthermore, our choice of cylinder radius was motivated by scale dependence analyses in literature (\cite{Blanton:2006aa}, \cite{Wilman:2010aa}, and \cite{Muldrew:2012aa}), which suggest that galactic properties such as color and quenched fractions are dependent on halo-scale properties such as host dark matter halo mass. \cite{Wilman:2010aa}, which uses environment defined by annuli of different radii, find positive correlation for quenched fraction and color on scales $< 1 \; \rm{Mpc}$ and anti-correlation on scales $> 3 \; \rm{Mpc}$. Our choice of $2 \rm{Mpc}/h$ provides sufficient sample size of galaxies in dense environments, for robust statistics, while tracing galactic properties within the halo scale. When we extend our analysis to cylindrical apertures with $R_{\rm{ap}} = 1 \; \rm{Mpc}/h$, we find that the change does not qualitatively change our results (difference in $f_{Q} < 0.05$). 
%Similar fixed aperture methods have also been used in \cite{Croton:2005aa} for galaxies in the 2dF Galaxy Redshift 
%Survey (\cite{Colless:2003aa}) and in \cite{Muldrew:2012aa} for a mock galaxy catalogue generated from embedding 
%galaxies onto the Millenium Dark Matter Simulation (\cite{Springel:2005aa}). 

With proper motivation for the fixed aperture environment definition, 
we now proceed to measuring the environment for our target galaxies. 
First, we construct a volume limited {\em Environment Defining 
Population} (EDP) with absolute magnitude cut-offs ($M_{r}$) at 
each redshift bin. EDP galaxies within the aperture surrounding each 
target galaxy are the neighboring galaxies in our definition of 
environment. The $M_{r}$ cut-offs for the EDP are selected so that 
the cumulative number density over $M_{r}$ at all redshift bins are 
equal. Not only does this provide a reasonably comparison of the 
environment measurements at different redshifts but it also seeks 
to construct an EDP that contains similar galaxy populations 
throughout our redshift range (i.e. to account for the progenitor bias 
in our EDP). As \cite{Behroozi:2013aa} and \cite{Leja:2013aa} find 
in their analysis of the cumulative number density method, the 
cumulative number density method, though it does not precisely 
account for the scatter in mass accretion or galaxy-galaxy mergers, 
provides a reasonable means to compare galaxy populations over 
a wide range of cosmic time. 

In constructing the EDP for the PRIMUS (hereafter PRIMUS EDP) we use the same PRIMUS data as the 
target galaxies, described in Section \ref{sec:target}. 
We restrict the PRIMUS galaxies to $0.2 < z < 0.8$ and divide them into bins of $\Delta z = 0.2$. 
Before we consider the cumulative number densities in these bins, we first determine $M_r$ limit for the 
highest redshift bin ($0.6-0.8$) by examining the $M_{r}$ distribution with bin size $\Delta M_{r} = 0.25$ 
and select $M_{r,\rm{lim}}$ near the peak of the distribution where bins with $M_{r} > M_{r,\rm{lim}}$ 
have fewer galaxies than the bin at $M_{r, \rm{lim}}$. 
We choose $M_{r, \rm{lim}}(0.6 < z < 0.8)$ to be, conservatively, $M_{r} = -20.75$. 
For the other redshift bins, we impose absolute magnitude limits ($M_{r,\rm{lim}}$) such 
that the cumulative number density of the bin ordered by $M_{r}$ is equal to the cumulative 
number density of the highest redshift bin. 
The cumulative number density calculations accounts for the statistical weights of the galaxies (Section 
\ref{sec:primus} and \ref{sec:sdss}).

For the SDSS-{\em GALEX} EDP (hereafter SDSS EDP), we do not use the parent data of 
the SDSS-{\em GALEX} target sample which uses the geometry of the combined angular selection function of the 
SDSS VAGC and {\em GALEX}. 
Instead, since FUV, NUV values are not necessary for EDP, we extend the parent data of the SDSS EDP
to the entire SDSS VAGC, including galaxies outside of the {\em GALEX} window function. 
Furthermore, we impose a redshift range of $0.0375-0.145$ on the SDSS EDP. 
This redshift range is due to the lack of faint galaxies at $z \sim 0.2$ and the lack of bright galaxies at 
$z \sim 0.01$ in the SDSS VAGC data.  
The lower bound for the redshift range was empirically determined by the bright limit and the upper bound 
by the faint limit of the $M_{r}$ versus redshift distribution. 
The same fixed cumulative number density method, described above, is used on this SDSS EDP to equate
the cumulative number density of SDSS EDP to the highest redshift bin of the PRIMUS EDP. 
Ultimately, we get $M_{r,\rm{lim}} = -20.57$, $-20.73$, $-20.80$ and $-20.95$ for the redshift bins $0.0375-0.145$, 
$0.2-0.4$, $0.4-0.6$, $0.6-0.8$, respectively.  %%%% PUT NEW VALUES
These absolute magnitude limits are illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:targetEDP}, which plots $M_{r}$ distribution as 
a function of redshift for the EDP (red) and the target galaxy sample (black). 

Finally with the EDP we measure the environment for each of the target sample galaxies by counting the number
of EDP galaxies, $n_{\rm{env}}$, with $RA$, $Dec$, and redshift within the aperture surrounding it. 
$n_{\rm{env}}$ accounts for the statistical weights of the EDP galaxies. 
%Since we use apertures of different dimensions, we are interested in the relative densitites rather than the actual $n_{env}$ values.
%Hence, we use the percentage rank of the galaxy environment to quantify overdense environments and underdense environments.
%More specifically, for each of the redshift bins ($0.2-0.4$, $0.4-0.6$, $0.6-0.8$, and $0.8-1.0$) the $n_{env}$ values for all target galaxies in that bin are listed and assigned a percentage rank based on their position in the list: $n_{env} = 0$ corresponding to $0\%$ and the maximum $n_{env}$ for a target galaxy in the $z$-bin corresponding to $100\%$. 
%Using these percentage ranks, each target galaxy is classified as high-, mid-, or low-environment based on the cut-offs specified in Table \ref{tab:aperture}. 
%Target sample galaxies are classified as high-environment if its percentage rank lies within the top $20\%$ and as low-environment if its percentage rank lies within the bottom $20\%$. 
%In Table \ref{tab:aperture}, apertures with radius $1 h^{-1} \rm{Mpc}$ have a low-eneivonrment cut-off of higher than $20\%$.
%This is because over $20\%$ of target sample galaxies have $n_{env}=0$ such a smaller aperture size.
%Hence we defined the low-environment percentage rank cut-off to contain all galaxies with $n_{env}=0$. 
%In order to have a fair comparison for the different $z$-bins when using this aperture, the low-environment cut-off was selected as the lowest cut-off that includes all galaxies with $n_{env}=0$ for all $z$-bin.
More specific details for the dense and sparse environment cut-offs the various apertures are provided in Table \ref{tab:aperture}.

\subsection{Edge Effects} \label{sec:edgeeffect}
One of the challenges in obtaining the galaxy environment using a fixed aperture method is accounting for the edges of the survey.
For galaxies located near the edge of the survey, part of the fixed aperture encompassing it will lie outside the survey regions. 
In this case, the $n_{env}$ will only reflect the fraction of the environment within the survey geometry.

In order to account for these edge effects, we use a Monte Carlo method to impose edge cuts on the target 
galaxy population. 
We begin by computing the angular separation, $\theta_{\rm{ap}}$ that corresponds to the radius of the 
aperture at the redshifts of the target galaxies.
Then the galaxies are matched to a sample of $N_{\rm{ransack}}=1,000,000$ points with $RA$ and $Dec$
 randomly generated within the window function of the EDP.  
We refer to this randomly generated redshift-less sample as the "ransack" sample, based on the procedure 
used to construct them. 
For each target galaxy, we count the number of ransack points, $n_{\rm{ransack}}$, within $\theta_{\rm{ap}}$
of the galaxy's $RA$ and $Dec$ value.
The $n_{\rm{ransack}}$ values are then compared to the expected value:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:ransack}
E[n_{\rm{ransack}}] = \frac{N_{\rm{ransack}}}{A_{\rm{EDP}}}\times {\pi \theta_{\rm{ap}}^2} \times f_{\rm{thresh}} 
\end{equation} 
where $A_{\rm{EDP}}$ is the total angular area of the target fields and $f_{\rm{thresh}}$ is the fractional 
threshold for the edge effect cut-off, which we vary based on $R_{\rm{ap}}$ (listed in Table \ref{tab:aperture}).
If $n_{\rm{ransack}}$ for a target galaxy is greater than $E[n_{\rm{ransack}}]$ then the target galaxy remains
in the sample; otherwise, it is discarded from the sample. 

%\section{Results}
%In the section below, we calculate stellar mass functions (SMFs) for the target galaxy population divided into 
%quiescent/star-forming and dense/sparse environment, Section \ref{sec:smf_const}. We use a non-parametric 
%$1/V_{\rm{max}}$ estimate of SMFs for the subsamples further divided into redshift bins. Then using these 
%SMFs, we calculate the quiescent fractions (QFs), Section \ref{sec:qf_const}, 
%and examine it's evolution over our redshift range. 

\section{Stellar Mass Function} \label{sec:smf}
The target galaxy sample defined above has so far
been classified into quiescent or star-forming and 
dense or sparse. We further divide these subsamples 
into bins of redshift: $0.0375-0.145$, 
$0.2-0.4$, $0.4-0.6$, and $0.6-0.8$. While the 
PRIMUS data ranges from $0.2 < z < 1.2$, we only 
consider galaxies with $ z<0.8$ due to insufficient
statistics for robust environment measurements at 
$z > 0.8$. With added redshift bins, we have a
total of 16 subsamples. We calculate the SMF for 
each of these 16 subsamples. 
%% EMPHASIZE THE FACT THAT WE HAVE ENVIRONMENT MEASURES AND A ROBUST ENOUGH DATA TO PROBE 
%% UP TO REDSHIFT 0.7! THAT WAY WE CAN SEE THE MASS DISTRIBUTION OF VERY SPECIFIC POPULATIONS OF
%% GALAXIES UP TO A PRETTY HIGH REDSHIFT!

To calculate the SMFs we employ a non-parametric 
$1/{V_{\rm{max}}}$ estimator commonly used for 
galaxy luminosity functions and stellar mass functions
, as done in \cite{Moustakas:2013aa} and discussed 
in the review \cite{Johnston:2011aa}. The differential 
SMF is given by the following equation:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:phi}
\Phi(\rm{log}\: \mathcal{M}) \Delta(\rm{log} \:\mathcal{M}) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{N} \frac{w_i}{V_{\rm{max,avail},i}}. 
\end{equation}
The equation above is same as Equation 3. in 
\cite{Moustakas:2013aa} except for the distinction that 
we use $V_{\rm{max,avail}}$ instead than $V_{\rm{max}}$, 
to account for the edge effects of the survey for our
environment measurements. $w_i$ here represents 
the statistical weight of each galaxy $i$ and 
$\Phi(\rm{log}\: \mathcal{M}) \Delta(\rm{log}\: \mathcal{M})$ 
is the number of galaxies ($N$) per unit volume within the 
stellar mass range 
$[\rm{log} \:\mathcal{M}, \rm{log} \:\mathcal{M}+\Delta(\rm{log} \:\mathcal{M})]$.

$V_{\rm{max},i}$ is the maximum cosmological volume 
where it is possible to observe galaxy $i$ given the apparent 
magnitude limits of the survey. However in Section \ref{sec:edgeeffect} 
we remove the galaxies that lie on the edge from our sample. 
In doing so we reduce the maximum cosmological volume 
where a galaxy can be observed, thereby reducing $V_{\rm{max},i}$.

To calculate $V_{\rm{max,avail},i}$, we generate a sample of 
points with random $RA$, $Dec$ within the window function of 
the target sample and $z$ in the redshift range. This is not to be 
confused with the ransack sample in Section \ref{sec:edgeeffect}. 
We then impose the same edge cuts we applied to the target 
galaxy population. At redshift bins of $\Delta z \sim 0.01$, we 
compute theraction of random points that remain in the bin after 
the edge cuts: $f_{\rm{edge}}$. Afterwards we apply this factor to 
compute $V_{\rm{max,avail}} = V_{\rm{max}} \times f_{\rm{edge}}$. 
The $V_{\rm{max}}$ in the equation above are computed following 
the method described in \cite{Moustakas:2013aa} Section 4.2 with 
the same redshift-dependent $K$-correction from observed SED 
and luminosity evolution model.

In order to calculate the uncertainty of the SMFs from the sample 
variance, we use a standard jackknife technique as done in \cite{Moustakas:2013aa}.
For the PRIMUS target galaxies, we calculate SMFs after excluding 
one of the five target fields each time. And for the SDSS target galaxies
we divide the field into a 30 $\times$ 20 rectangular $RA$ and $Dec$ 
grid and calculate the SMFs after excluding part of the field each time. 
Then using the calculated SMFs we calculate the uncertainty: 
\begin{equation}
\sigma^j = \sqrt{\frac{M-1}{M} \sum\limits_{k=1}^{M} (\Phi^j_k - \langle \Phi^j \rangle)^2}
\end{equation} 
$M$ in this equation is the number of jack knife SMFs in the stellar mass
bins. $\langle \Phi^j \rangle$ is the mean number density of galaxies 
in each stellar mass bin for all of the jack knife $\Phi^j$s. 

SMFs for 16 target galaxy subsamples classified into quiescent/star-forming (orange/blue)and 
dense/spare environments are presented in Figure \ref{fig:smf}. The 
redshift evolution of the SMFs are indicated by a darker shade for lower
redshifts. The sample variance uncertainties are represented by the 
width of the SMFs. The environment measurements and classifications
for Figure \ref{fig:smf} are done using a cylindrical aperture with dimensions,
$R_{\rm{ap}} = 2 \; \rm{Mpc}/h$ and $H_{\rm{ap}} = 25 \; \rm{Mpc}/h$. 

Examining the SMF evolution from $z \sim 0.7$ to $z \sim 0.1$, 
we find that in dense environments both the star-forming and quiescent
SMFs increase at $\mathcal{M}_{*}$ below the knee of mass function 
($\rm{log}\: \mathcal{M}_{*}/\mathcal{M}_{\odot} < 10.75$ for star-forming; 
$\rm{log}\: \mathcal{M}_{*}/\mathcal{M}_{\odot} < 11.0$ for quiescent). 
Meanwhile, at masses above the knee the SMFs for dense environments 
exhibit little change throughout the redshift range.

At sparse environments, the quiescent SMF remains relatively constant 
for galaxies with $\rm{log}\: \mathcal{M}_{*}/\mathcal{M}_{\odot} < 10.75$.
At higher stellar masses, however, the SMF decreases notably. Finally 
the sparse environment star-forming SMF shows a decrease at all 
stellar mass ranges over the redshift range.

\section{Quiescent Fraction} \label{sec:qf_const}
The SMFs calculated in the previous section describe
the distribution of our galaxy population in stellar mass 
and reveal the evolution of this distribution
over comic time. From the SMFs, we 
compute the quiescent fractions in order to compare the 
quiescent and the star-forming populations 
and to quantify the fraction of galaxies that have
depleted their star-formation. Furthermore, by dividing our 
galaxy sample using environment measurements into dense
and sparse samples, we investigate the environment 
dependence on the quiescent fraction and consequently 
on environment dependent quenching mechanisms. 

From the SMF number densities ($\Phi$)
in the previous section, the quiescent fraction is computed 
as follows, 
\begin{equation}
f_{\rm{Q}} = \frac{\Phi_{Q}}{\Phi_{SF}+\Phi_{Q}}.
\end{equation}
$\Phi_{Q}$ and $\Phi_{SF}$ are the total number of galaxies 
per unit volume in stellar mass bin of $\Delta(\rm{log} \: \mathcal{M}) = 0.25$ 
for the quiescent and star-forming subsamples, respectively 
(Equation \ref{eq:phi}). We compute $f_{\rm{Q}}$ for dense 
and spare environments over our redshift range as plotted in
 Figure \ref{fig:qf}, which shows the evolution of $f_{\rm{Q}}$ 
 for dense (right) and sparse (left) environments. As in 
 Figure \ref{fig:smf}, the darker shading represent lower redshifts. 

In both sparse and dense environments, Figure \ref{fig:qf}
clearly shows an increase in $f_{\rm{Q}}$ with decrease in redshift at all 
stellar masses. Qualitatively, this $f_{\rm{Q}}$ evolution 
exhibits a notable mass dependence. More specifically, 
the $f_{\rm{Q}}$ in sparse environments shows a greater 
evolution between redshift bins at high masses than at low 
masses. On the other hand, the $f_{\rm{Q}}$ in dense 
environments shows a greater evolution between redshift 
bins at low masses than at high masses.

There is a significant increase in $f_{Q}(\mathcal{M}_{\rm{fid}})$ with decrease in redshift for both environments. In addition, over the entire redshift range, $f_{Q}(\mathcal{M}_{\rm{fid}})$ for dense environment is greater than $f_{Q}(\mathcal{M}_{\rm{fid}})$ for lower environment. However the difference in $f_{Q}(\mathcal{M}_{\rm{fid}})$ for the two environments remains constant throughout suggesting that while the quiescent fraction is higher in dense environments, the evolution of the quiescent fraction is independent of environment.}         \label{fig:qffit}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}
%fiducial mass may be 11.0 depending on what we want.
% fixed slope? Can't do fixed slope if we say there is mass dependence in f_q evolution

While trends are apparent from Figure \ref{fig:qf}, quantitative comparisons of the 
$f_{\rm{Q}}$ for different environment over redshift is made challenging by the distinct stellar mass 
completeness limits for each redshift bin. In order to quantify the quiescent fraction over the stellar mass complete rate, we fit each $f_{\rm{Q}}$ to a power-law parameterization as a function of stellar mass, 
\begin{equation} 
f_{\rm{Q}}(\mathcal{M}_{*}) = a \: \rm{log} \; \left(\frac{ \mathcal{M}_{*}}{10^{10.5} \: \mathcal{M}_{\odot}} \right)+b,
\end{equation}
where $a$ are $b$ are best-fit parameters using {\em MPFIT} (\cite{Markwardt:2009aa}).
The value $10^{10.5} \: \mathcal{M}_{\odot}$ in the equation represents an empirically selected
fiducial mass $\mathcal{M}_{\rm{fid}}$ within the stellar mass completeness limits. This fiducial mass 
serves to highlight and quantify the $f_{\rm{Q}}$ evolution for different redshifts and using $\mathcal{M}_{\rm{fid}} = 10^{11} \mathcal{M}_\odot$ 
does not notably alter the results. Figure \ref{fig:qffit} shows the evolution of $f_{\rm{Q}}(\mathcal{M}_{\rm{fid}})$ from $z \sim 0.7$ to $\sim 0.1$ 
for sparse (diamond) and dense (circle) environments.
For both dense and spare environments, $f_{\rm{Q}}(\mathcal{M}_{\rm{fid}})$ increases as redshift decreases. In addition, through the redshift range explored in our analysis, dense environment $f_{\rm{Q}}(\mathcal{M}_{\rm{fid}})$ is significantly greater than the sparse environment $f_{\rm{Q}}(\mathcal{M}_{\rm{fid}})$. However when we compute $f_{\rm{Q}}(\mathcal{M}_{\rm{fid}})_{\rm{dense}} - f_{\rm{Q}}(\mathcal{M}_{\rm{fid}})_{\rm{sparse}}$, we find the difference remains constant throughout the redshift range ($ < 0.15$ throughout redshift range). Furthermore, the total evolution of $f_{\rm{Q}}(\mathcal{M}_{\rm{fid}})$ from $z \sim 0.7$ to $\sim 0.1$ show no strong environment dependence. 

The analysis described in this paper use a fixed cylindrical aperture with dimensions $R_{\rm{ap}} = 2 \: \rm{Mpc}$ and $H_{\rm{ap}} = 25 \: \rm{Mpc}$ to measure environment, the same analysis was extended for varying aperture dimensions $R_{\rm{ap}} = 1, 2, 3 \: \rm{Mpc}$ and $H_{\rm{ap}} = 25, 50 \: \rm{Mpc}$. 
Minor adjustments to the environment classification thresholds were adopted in these analyses for the smaller apertures ($r_{\rm{ap}} = 0.5, 1 \rm{Mpc}$ and $r_{\rm{ap}} = 25 \rm{Mpc}$).
The results obtained from using these different are consistent with the results displayed in this paper. 

\section{Summary}
We have measured the SMFs and QFs using low redshift SDSS-{\em GALEX} galaxies and intermeidate redshift PRIMUS galaxies. 
Specifically we anlayzed the evolution of the QFs over the redshift range $0.0-1.0$ for galaxies in environment densities (Figure \ref{fig:qf}). 
We find that there is an expected increase in QF with decrease in the redshift for subsamples in all environment densities.
More importantly we find that the change in QF over redshift is independent of the environment and remains relatively equal for all environments.
